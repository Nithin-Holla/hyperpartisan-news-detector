Trump to undo Obama order , allow local police to have additional military-like items
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Trump administration is preparing to restore the flow of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies .
The government program had been sharply curtailed by the Obama administration amid an outcry over police use of armored vehicles and other war-fighting gear to confront protesters .
Documents obtained by The Associated Press indicate President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order undoing an Obama-era directive that restricted police access to military grenade launchers , firearms , ammunition and other gear .
The documents say Trump 's order would fully restore the program under which `` assets that would otherwise be scrapped can be repurposed to help state , local , and tribal law enforcement better protect public safety and reduce crime. ``

[ Graphic 18+ ] Scores of dead ISIS terrorists litter streets of Al-Mayadeen - video
BEIRUT , LEBANON ( 4:50 P. M. ) - The battle for Al-Mayadeen proved to be a decisive victory for the Syrian Arab Army ( SAA ) and their allies , as they were able to successfully uproot the so-called Islamic State ( ISIS ) from this large city in the Deir Ezzor Governorate .
For ISIS , their defeat at Al-Mayadeen could not come at a worse time , as their battlefield woes in Al-Raqqa and central Syria have handicapped their remaining forces inside the country .
On Sunday , Syrian news channels posted several videos showing the aftermath of the Al-Mayadeen battle and the recently liberated areas surrounding the city .
The footage showed scores of dead ISIS terrorists and a large number of armored vehicles that were destroyed by the Syrian Arab Army during their one week long offensive .
Gone .
With Al-Mayadeen liberated , the Syrian Army will now turn their attention to the provincial capital and Al- ‘ Umar Oil Fields in order to expel the Islamic Sate from more areas in Syria .

Trump travel ban can be enforced , says US Supreme Court
The US Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump 's ban on travellers from six Muslim-majority countries and two others can go into full effect , even as legal challenges against the executive order continue in several states .
The ban means that the US can refuse entry visas to travellers from Chad , Iran , Libya , Somalia , Syria and Yemen , as well as North Korea and Venezuela .
`` The ruling does not mean that the Supreme Court has accepted the ban as constitutional , but that it finds persuasive the Trump administration 's argument that an emergency injunction against the ban was unnecessary , '' The GuardianUS Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the ruling `` a substantial victory for the safety and security of the American people '' .
`` The Constitution gives the President the responsibility and power to protect this country from all threats foreign and domestic , and this order remains vital to accomplishing those goals , '' Sessions said .
Omar Jadwat , director of the American Civil Liberties Union 's Immigrants ' Rights Project said he was disappointed by the court 's decision .
`` President Trump 's anti-Muslim prejudice is no secret - he has repeatedly confirmed it , including just last week on Twitter , '' Jadwat told The Washington Post
The Spirit of Free Speech at UC Berkeley : Why the Left Opposes It
In an article focusing on free speech on the campus , The New York Times '' Free Speech Week '' eventRick MoranannouncedTo confound issues even more , Milo Yiannopoulos announced he would appear and speak anyway at the famous Sproul Plaza , the site of the 1964 Free Speech Movement protest .
Promising surprises , he now is asserting his right to free speech as a private citizen to speak on campus without any formal group sponsorship or invitation .
Saying he would appear this Sunday at noon , there is certain to be a large police presence as well as a vast group of leftist protestors , most likely including Antifa groups .
As of today — the 23rd — the event will not take place .
Yet Milo 's appearance — should he show up — has forced the university authorities to spend one million dollars arranging for security , since they fear the kind of violence that erupted in Charlottesville when Antifa appeared to contest the neo-Nazis and racists who planned a rally there .
It 's getting very expensive for conservatives to speak .
Recently , Ben Shapiro spoke without incident and reported he had a fruitful exchange of opinion with liberal and leftist students , although security for his talk cost UC Berkeley $ 600,000 .

CNN Commentator : Trump Thinks 'He Is a Slave Master of Black People '
Apparently , condemning the NFL 's kneeling protests of the national anthem is a step too far for CNN commentator Keith Boykin .
He believes that , because of President Trump 's tweeting , he sees an anti African-American trend -- that Trump is a racist puppet master , attempting to pull the strings on the black community .
Boykin said , `` We have a white supremacist president of the United States .
He 's encouraging white supremacists. ``
And the CNN host even called him out for saying that , questioning whether he could back up that statement .
But , then he said something even more radical : It 's not about respect for the flag .
It 's about fanning the flames of racial hatred and this president is a master of that and that 's the reason why he 's playing plantation politics .
He thinks apparently that he is a slave master of black people in the NFL , of black people in the country .

What issues divide the nation during the civil war ?
When the constitution was being forged , there was much discussion about what exactly the nation was to be .
Some wanted only the loosest of connections between the states , with states being more like individual nations and the Federal Government being little more than a common union , agreeing to join together to protect from outside forces that would attempt to harm any state .
When the northern states decided that slavery was to be illegal , southern states were concerned about how they would continue to run their plantations .
The issue of `` states rights '' was one of the largest concerns during the time before the civil war broke out .
Southern states wanted to decide for themselves if slavery was to be legal , not letting northern states make such decisions for them .
People from the north found the practice to be so reprehensible that they wanted to force the south to stop the practice .
While slavery was a significant reason for the civil war , States Rights divided the nation and the defeat of states rights was a significant blow to the efforts of the original founders of the constitution .

The Daily Show ' imagines what a Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden fight would look like
Daily Show Joe Biden Donald Trump Comedy CentralHonestly , at this point in the 2016 presidential election , nothing should surprise you anymore .
That includes when a sitting vice president says at a rally that he 's ready for fisticuffs with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump .
But it 's just another nugget for the late-night shows to feed off of , and that 's what `` The Daily Show '' did Wednesday night .
Host Trevor Noah broke down the situation : Vice President Joe Biden said on the campaign trail for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that he does n't want to debate Trump , and instead he wishes they were in high school so Biden could take Trump `` behind the gym .
`` Trump responded by saying at one of his rallies , `` Joe Biden wants to take me to the back of the barn… I 'd love that .
`` Noah , now confused about where the fight is actually going to take place , points out , `` This is why you do n't let old guys into Fight Club .
The first rule of Fight Club is remember where Fight Club is .

Far-right leaders have double standards for immigrants
The rise of right wing nationalism comes with a massive side dose of bad faith arguments .
So argues Sasha Polakow-Suransky , the author of `` Go Back to Where You Came From : The Backlash Against Immigration and the Fate of Western DemocracyPeople like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen are reactionaries , Polakow-Suransky told me on `` Salon Talks , '' but they like to hide behind liberal values like equality and secularism when launching attacks on Muslim immigrants .
`` What these parties are doing , especially in France and Holland , is they 're telling gays , they 're telling feminists , and they 're telling Jews even , ‘ We are the only ones who will protect you , '' he said .
`` The threat all of you face is from Islam and Muslims and we 're the only party that can stand up to that .
' '' These politicians want voters to believe they 're not neo-Nazis and skinheads , he continued , but in reality , they 're `` weaponizing secularism to target a specific group .
`` Polakow-Suransky , who is an Open Society Foundations fellow and has held previous positions as an op-ed editor at the New York Times and as a senior editor at Foreign Affairs , says he sees similarity in how `` our president reacts to a horrible terrorist attack , '' such as the murders in New York City on Halloween , and other crimes .
`` You see a real gulf between the reactions to any crime perpetrated by an Islamic extremist and crimes committed by white nationalists or other groups , '' Polakow-Suransky said .
`` I think that shows they 're targeting a specific group rather than talking about universal values that we all share .

Uber Driver Catches Cop In A Lie About The Law And Totally Schools Him
When you 're caught in a lie , it can be difficult to know what to do .
As much as it may be morally correct to admit your wrongdoing , that 's too embarrassing and shameful for some individuals to handle .
Unfortunately , that 's why many people find themselves only getting deeper and deeper into their lies .
In order to cover up for themselves , they just keep making up more and more details until their story spirals out of control .
One group of people that tend to know how to deal with liars easily are legal professionals .
So when this cop tried to make up a law right to an attorney , you can imagine that things quickly got out of hand ! Like many people looking to make a few extra dollars these days , Wilmington , North Carolina resident Jesse Bright had been using some of his spare time to serve as a driver for the ride-sharing app Uber .
However , he also had a day job—one that would come in handy later .
Soon enough , Jesse was surrounded by officers .
He thought that the whole situation seemed suspicious , to the point that he was afraid that one of the cops may have slipped something onto his passenger seat .

ISIS sex slave describes horrifying scenes : 'Forced to do things that were disgusting '
Depraved ISIS thugs are little more than serial rapists who claim sex assault is a byproduct of implementing teachings of the Qur'an .
The grisly details are laid out in a new report by Nikita Malik called , `` Trafficking Terror : How Modern Slavery and Sexual Violence Fund TerrorismIn it , a Yazidi survivor describes how ISIS henchman would line up young girls against walls before groping their chests .
`` If they had breasts , they could be raped ; if not , they would wait three months to check again , '' Victim 1 said , according to an interview cited in the reportThe girls - many of them minors - were raped together in rooms as children looked on , she said after finally eluding ISIS ' grip .
Victim 1 also described how she was raped by six ISIS guards one night after attempting to flee .
`` She was raped in every place possible , '' the report readsYazidi women were told by brainwashed ISIS brides that they needed to be raped to become fully Muslim , according to the report .
They were often sold , but lost monetary value the more times they were purchased by men in Iraq and Syria .
The report also describes how sexual depravity continues to act as a pull factor for prospective terrorists '' Sexual slavery serves as an incentive for new recruits and foreign fighters , with the promise of wives and sex slaves. ``
writes Malik .
The Henry Jackson Society reports human trafficking brought Islamic terrorist groups upwards of $ 30 million last year .
It 's believed ISIS could turn to kidnapping and sex slavery as a means to sustain itself as its shrinking caliphate continues to crumble .
Nicolle Wallace : Ex-White House officials admit Trump 's inner circle is ‘ flying blind ' where Mueller investigation is going
`` Three Republicans with close ties to the Trump White House , all veterans from previous Republican administrations , tell me that it 's clear from their conversations and contacts with the president 's inner circle that Bob Mueller is trying to build an obstruction of justice case , '' MSNBC host of `` Deadline : White House '' reported Tuesday .
`` One of them going even farther and saying that the White House is now flying blind and does n't know who else might already be cooperating with Mueller 's team , '' Wallace explained .
That was not the only major news Wallace broke in the first minutes of her show .
Wallace also introduced former U. S. Attorney Chuck Rosenberg , who worked on the staff of both Robert Mueller and James Comey of the FBI .
`` Would you surmise that Donald Trump 's taxes are something that Bob Mueller either has or will seek to obtain ? ''
Wallace asked .
`` I would , Nicolle , and here 's why .
I was a federal prosecutor for a long time and a white collar prosecutor , at the beginning of any case what you need are leads , how do you get those ?
The first thing you do , you get credit reports and you get tax returns , '' Rosenberg explained .
`` I do n't know that they have the tax returns , but I know what white collar tax attorneys do , they get tax returns , '' Rosenberg noted .
Donald Trump Does n't Believe in the Constitution
Donald Trumpas raised by Khizr and Ghazala Khan during the DNCThis disdain was on full display Monday .
When talking about the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey , Trump lamented the factPutting aside Trump 's inaccurate assessment of the quality of medical care prisoners receivewoefully underfunded public defender systemGideon v. WainwrightThis protection for criminal defendants is cause for celebration , not castigation .
Speaking about this right in glowing terms , the Supreme Court has saidSimilarly , the Eighth Amendment prohibits `` cruel and unusual punishment. ``
We already know from Trump 's advocating extreme forms of tortureThe Supreme Court has explainedJust this weekend , he once again showed that he could n't care less about the First Amendment .
After The New York Times published a storyTrump tweetedOf course , as any middle school student will tell you , the First Amendment protects the freedom of the press .
Part of that protection is that no public figure can sue as a result of a bad storyIt 's been clear from other contexts , though , that `` virtually meaninglessTrump is no fan of the rest of the Constitution either .
His recently announced maternity leave plan includes no coverage for fatherswomen and doctors should be punished for abortionhe has promised to violate treatiesdoes n't understand the differencecare about separation of powersIn other words , other than his repeated invocation of the Second Amendment , including his not-so-oblique referencescame up again this weekendnormal democratic boundsamendment processThis is highly unusual in American politics , where most debate occurs against the backdrop of accepted constitutional principles .
Trump does n't appear to accept those principles at all , and instead seems to want to be president of a country with a foreign understanding of government and its relationship to the people .
If Trump were elected , he would have to swear the same allegiance to the Constitution that every president has before him : `` I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .
`` Based on how he has campaigned over the past year , if he were to utter those last 10 words , he would be lying - as has become par for the course
Donald Trump : Russia probe a 'hoax , ' media was 'greatest influence '
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Friday called allegations of Russian election meddling a `` hoax , '' and insisted the media was the `` greatest influence '' on the 2016 campaign .
Trump 's tweets early Friday appeared to respond to Facebook 's announcement that the social media giant will provide to congressional investigators the contents of 3,000 ads bought by a Russian agency .
`` The Russia hoax continues , now it 's ads on Facebook .
What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favour of Crooked Hillary ?
`` He later added : `` The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media ‘ screaming ' for Crooked Hillary Clinton .

Raw Video : 2 officers shot outside of Ferguson police department
Published March 12 , 2015BREAKING : Two police officers reportedly were shot early Thursday outside the police department in Ferguson , Mo .
amid protests that followed the resignation of the town 's police chief .
The shooting was first reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch .
Ferguson Police Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff told the paper that he did not believe the officers were from his department and had no information on the extend of their injuries .
The Post-Dispatch reported , citing a police source , that one of the officers was from St. Louis County , while the other was from Webster Groves , another St. Louis suburb located south of Ferguson .
KTVI reported that as many as 200 protesters had gathered outside the police station to demand more changes in the city 's government after the resignation of Police Chief Tom Jackson Wednesday afternoon .
The station reported that at least one person had been arrested and that protesters were blocking traffic on nearby Florissant Road .
The Associated Press reported that the crowd had appeared to be dwindling when the shots were heard .
The Missouri Highway Patrol told the AP that troopers were heading to the scene .
Jackson was the sixth Ferguson employee to resign or be fired after a Justice Department report cleared white former officer Darren Wilson of civil rights charges in the shooting of black 18-year-old Michael Brown this past August , but found a profit-driven court system and widespread racial bias in the city police department .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
Republicans approve 36-year-old judicial nominee who has never tried a case
President Donald Trump 's nominee for federal judge in Alabama was just approved by every Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee — even though he was unanimously rated `` not qualified '' by the American Bar Association .
Brett J. Talley is 36 years old , has only practiced law for three years and made a series of partisan comments on his blog in 2016 that would normally be considered unbecoming of a judge , like referring to the Democratic presidential candidate as `` Hillary Rotten Clinton , '' according to the Los Angeles TimesOne of Talley 's most controversial statements was a blog post in which he claimed that President Barack Obama was `` about to launch the greatest attack on our constitutional freedoms in our lifetime .
`` He added , `` The object of that war is to make guns illegal , in all forms. ``
After a commenter wrote that Americans would `` resort to arms when our other rights — of speech , press , assembly , representative government — fail to yield the desired results , '' Talley said he agreed with him .
When asked about these statements by the Senate Judiciary Committee , Talley said he was merely `` trying to generate discussion .
I wanted people to be able to use my blog to discuss issues , to come together and find common ground .
`` The president has directly praised Talley as being an `` untold story '' that `` nobody wants to talk about .
`` `` When you think of it , Mitch [ McConnell ] and I were saying , that has consequences 40 years out , depending on the age of the judge , '' Trump said in October .
`` But 40 years out .
`` One other factor that may have contributed to Talley 's nomination : He was mentored by Sen. Luther Strange of Alabama and worked in the Justice Department office that chooses judicial nominees .
Talley is n't the only Trump judicial nominee who has been the subject of raised questions
Trump reportedly tried to privately ‘ rationalize ' KKK membership in wake of Charlottesville
According to the latest damning snippetMichael Wolff 's Fire and FuryDonald TrumpFrom the New York Times review There are lots of arresting details in the book .
We learn that the administration holds special animus for what it calls `` D. O. J. women , '' or women who work in the Justice Department .
Wolff writes that after the white supremacist mayhem in Charlottesville , Va. , Trump privately rationalized `` why someone would be a member of the K. K. K. `` Many believe the anecdotes and quotes from Wolff 's book should be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism , but this one is not implausible .
Trump went on the record in the wake of the Charlottesville white supremacy march that left Heather Heyer dead , saying he believed there were `` good peopleTrump was widely criticized for the response , which many considered a tacit endorsement of white supremacy .
During his presidential campaign , an old New York Times story was unearthed that reported Trump 's father , Fred , back in 1927 , was arrested at a rally in 1927 where KKK members were present .
It was never proven whether he was participating in the rally or a member of the group .

John Ashcroft : This is Not The Justice Department That I Knew
Former U. S. Attorney General John Ashcroft on the outrage over the Clinton email investigation .
With FBI Director James Comey announcing the investigation into Hillary Clinton 's email scandal would be reopened , Former U. S. Attorney General John Ashcroft weighs in on the backlash as well as the political fallout as Election Day quickly approaches .
`` Well , first of all , I 'm deeply saddened by what 's happened by the Justice Department , '' Ashcroft told the FOX Business Network 's Neil Cavuto .
Ashcroft then brought up claims that the Department of Justice blocked the FBI from using many of the investigative tools available to it in its investigation of the Clinton Foundation .
`` There 's been a pervasive perversion of the Justice Department process over and over again and recent reports like in The Wall Street Journal that suggest that , not only suggest , allege that the Justice Department has denied investigative tools to be used in investigations related to the Clinton Foundation and frankly , the absence of the use of tools that should have been used in the initial investigation of Hillary Clinton .
`` As a result , Ashcroft explained , `` The Justice Department sent the FBI in to investigate the Clinton Foundation with its hands tied behind its back .
`` The fact that the investigation is being reopened now , so close to the election , was not a surprise to Ashcroft , but the result of stonewalling by Hillary Clinton and her staffers .
`` This is n't an October surprise in my judgment , this is the continuity of an issue which had been stonewalled , for which information had been requested which was not fully given and there was an erroneous statement earlier , much to the acclaim of the people who did the stonewalling , that the investigation was over .
`` According to Ashcroft , it is unfair for the Clinton campaign to blame the FBI for the timing of the announcement when the campaign 's stonewalling is ultimately at fault due to its lack of transparency and delays in providing information requested .
`` There 's a sense in which it 's a little disingenuous to be complaining about information coming out late when you are the cause of the information coming out late because of a significant stonewalling effort that 's been unfortunately facilitated by the way in which the Attorney General and others have allowed this particular investigation to be conducted .
`` Ashcroft viewed this investigation as damaging the credibility of the Justice Department he once knew .
`` This is not the Justice Department that I knew , in which I trusted , which I admired. ``
WATCH : Alex Jones convulses in demonic rant against ‘ evil ' Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski
Alex Jones delivered one of his all-time wildest rants against MSNBC 's Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski , whom he compared to demons , parasites and disease .
The InfoWars host attacked the `` Morning Joe '' co-hosts Tuesday in a crazed tirade that included a bug-eyed , tongue-lolling impersonation of a demonic Brzezinski , reported Right Wing Watch '' They 're both like horrible foot-long tapeworms , man , I 'm telling you , '' Jones said .
`` Tapeworms that we vomited out and crapped out and they 're just trying to force-feed themselves back into our lives .
They 're like gonorrhea or syphilis , I mean they are just — they 're like HIV , they 're like cancer .
They are just — I mean , you have to understand , folks , they literally want to destroy you .
God , they 're evil .
Do you realize how evil these people are ?
`` He promised the friends-turned-critics of President Donald Trump would be `` removed '' once Jones and his followers triumphed over their enemies , and then launched into a frenzied spasm of unholy gibberish .
`` They 're like from upside-down world , folks , '' Jones said , making a reference to the Netflix series `` Stranger Things. ``
`` You have to understand .
They 've broken into this dimension .
They want to destroy us. ``
Pay Attention ! FBI Says `` Black Identity Extremists '' Pose Growing Threat To Cops
Image via Michael B. Thomas/Getty ImagesThis is how it starts .
Everyone needs to pay attention because one day we might look back at this moment as a pivotal moment when the federal government reinvigorated a campaign against Black protestersactivistsAccording to ForeignPolicyPeep the langage used here : `` The FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist ( BIE ) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated , retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence , '' '' Perceptions '' .
PERCEPTIONS .
`` Perceptions of police brutality against African Americans '' …ai n't no `` perceptions '' , b ! tc # !
We KNOW the police whoop our azzes just for living .
Our collective response to the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson is the catalyst for the Black boogie men who are taking aim at cops if you let them tell it : `` The FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated , violent criminal activity within the BIE movement , '' Again , `` alleged '' .
Pay .
Attention .
The feds are labeling Black folks who are angry at systemic racism as domestic terrorists .
Something that the President did n't do when addressing the tiki-torchers in Charlottesville .
You know what America does when they perceive a group of people to be terrorists…at least when they 're Black or brown .
Guess they do n't see neo-Nazis and alt-right azzholes in that same light .
Imagine that .
Fmr . FBI Asst . Director : Comey 's Professional , Ethical Experience is at Risk
Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom weighs in on significance behind the FBI reopening the case against Hillary Clinton .
The FBI announced Friday afternoon it will reopen its investigation of Hillary Clinton 's use of a private e-mail server during her tenure as Secretary of State .
The decision comes as the FBI said it is reviewing new information related to the original case .
James Kallstrom , former FBI assistant director , discussed the news on the FOX Business Network .
`` These guys that run the FBI now came to the conclusion that they look like absolute fools and that they 've done a horrible job , they 've thrown the agents under the bus , they discredited the FBI 's reputation , '' he told Neil Cavuto .
`` And I can tell the people listening to you , it 's not the FBI agents , believe me .
It 's two or three people at the top of the FBI .
`` Kallstrom believes the government agency should n't have started an investigation in the first place if it did n't meet certain guidelines .
`` If they were not ever going to impanel a grand jury , that means you really do n't conduct a criminal investigation .
You do n't have subpoena power , you do n't have warrants .
That was apparently apparent early on in this investigation .
I would 've liked to have seen somebody with the integrity not to just conduct an investigation that does n't meet any of the criteria of how the FBI operates , '' he stated .
He added : `` I suspect that they never had a really bonafide investigation because the Justice Department would n't let them do it .

9 Famous Criminals Who Were Murdered in Prison
For some criminals , the notoriety that comes with getting caught for murder , rape , and other horrific crimes is exactly what they want .
The newspaper articles , biographies , and constant attention that are often attached to the world 's most evil crimes give certain criminals a sense of purpose , as if they are celebrities who will have their names remembered long after they 're dead .
Unfortunately , being a notorious criminal also has plenty of downsides , especially when you 're heading to a prison filled with other hardened criminals .
For a few famous criminals , fame is what leads to their untimely death within the walls of prison .
If you 've been wondering `` Who are the most famous criminals to be murdered in prison ? ''
this list holds the answers .
The men on this list have proved that maintaining a low profile in prison beats having a famous name , since being well known for their heinous crimes is what got many of these criminals a death sentence not ordered by the legal system .
From cannibalistic serial killers to pedophiles who ruined the lives of hundreds of children , the men on this list were murdered in prison by fellow inmates , whether it was due to their notoriety or personal issues .
Albert DeSalvo was better known as the confessed `` Boston Strangler , '' who killed 13 women .
While DeSalvo never ended up in jail for those crimes , he served a prison sentence for being a serial rapist .
DeSalvo attempted to escape from prison , but the escape was shortlived .
In 1973 , Robert Wilson was suspected of stabbing DeSalvo to death but he was never convicted for the crime .

Fox News pundits debate whether Hillary Clinton should go to jail for Trump 's Russia scandal
A Fox News host and panelist alleged that it was Hillary Clinton that colluded with RussiaWhile Russian bots sowed divisionattacked people of colorattacked Hillary Clintonthen spread fake voter fraud claims '' Well , if it 's really a big threat and we want to stop them from meddling in our elections , why is it that during a three-year time span the Obama administration really did n't do much to stop this from happening , '' asked Town Hall editor Katie Pavlich .
She referred to the 2012 election debate in which Mitt Romney cautioned that Russia was the greatest American foe over radical ISIS or Taliban extremists .
However , 2016 was the first election Russia is known to have infiltrated .
Pavlich and the host then turned to wonder why 300 elected officials did n't show up for the classified briefing held at the FBI involving the `` Gang of 8. ``
The 300 members likely did n't have a high enough clearance level to view the classified documents .
The `` Gang of 8 '' all have the proper security clearance level to have viewed the documents .
The Fox host asked former Clinton staffer Adrienne Elrod if the entire Russia scandal could have been avoided if former President Barack Obama had stopped Russia before they even started .
Elrod explained that there was a lot of work going on behind the scenes .
Given the security level , it 's likely much of the information available at the time could not be made public .
She noted she wished Obama had acted prior to the election but asked what Trump is doing today to stop Russia from acting in the 2018 election .
The Fox host along with Pavlich went on to claim that Clinton was colluding with Russia because her campaign partially paid the law firm that bought the opposition research dossier from Christopher Steele .
Another portion of the dossier was paid for by Republicans hoping to discredit Trump prior to the general election .
For that reason , Fox News believes Clinton colluded with Russia more than Trump did .

Trump Falsely Claims Republican Robert Mueller Is A Democrat
Trump is so far off the reservation that he is claiming that Republican Special Counsel Robert Mueller is a Democrat who worked for Obama for eight years .
Neither of these statements is true .
Video : Trump said , `` But you have a group of investigators that are all Democrats .
In some cases , they went to the Hillary Clinton celebration that turned out to be a funeral .
So you have all these investigators that are Democrats .
In all fairness , Bob Mueller worked for Obama for eight years .
`` The Special Counsel is not a Democrat .
He is a Republican .
Robert Mueller did not work for Obama for eight years .
He was replaced as FBI Director by James Comey in 2013 .
In 2011 , Obama asked Mueller to say on beyond his initial ten-year term , and the Senate approved his request .
Trump is in complete meltdown modeFacts matter .
The fact is that Trump is lying and running away from doing an interview with Mueller .

Seal : I was n't attacking Oprah in social media post
Singer Seal is calling out critics for suggesting he attacked Oprah Winfrey over her relationship with Harvey Weinstein , insisting he was speaking out against hypocrisy in Hollywood .
The Kiss From a Rose star came under fire earlier this week after he took to Instagram to question Oprah 's friendship with the disgraced producer '' Oh I forgot , that 's right… you 'd heard the rumours but you had no idea he was actually serially assaulting young stary-eyed ( sic ) actresses who in turn had no idea what they were getting into .
My bad , '' he snapped , adding a meme featuring Oprah and Harvey at events together .
But now the singer insists he was n't trying to discredit Winfrey .
`` Now let 's get straight to it , '' he says in a new video posted on Facebook .
`` Let me start by saying that I have an enormous amount of respect for everything that Oprah has achieved and contributed in her life .
`` `` What I re-posted was not an attack on Oprah at all , '' he adds .
`` She just happened to be the person photographed with the pig ( Weinstein ) in the picture .
No , what I re-posted was commentary on the hypocritical and double standard nature and behaviour of Hollywood… '' In his message , Seal also slams actress Stacey Dash for tweeting a link to an article about Seal 's original post and writing , `` Ouch , he does make a good point though .

`` Do not re-tweet , re-quote anything I have said in order to reinforce your self-hating agenda… Again , this was not an attack against Oprah .
This was an observation of the toxic nature of Hollywood and I believe that a conscious people are a progressive people… '' Oprah addressed the Weinstein sex scandal on her Facebook account late last year , writing : `` I 've been processing the accounts of Harvey Weinstein 's hideous behavior and have n't been able to find the words to articulate the magnitude of the situation .
`` More than 80 women , including Mira Sorvino , Rose McGowan , Ashley Judd , and Gwyneth Paltrow , have now accused the disgraced studio boss of inappropriate behaviour , assault , rape , and misconduct .
Weinstein maintains that while he may have behaved badly in the past he has never forced a woman to have sex with him .

Jennifer Aniston And Justin Theroux 's Marriage In Trouble Because Of Chelsea Handler ?
Rumors that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are allegedly on the verge of divorce have been circulating as early as a few weeks into their marriage .
New reports claimed that there is a new woman involved in Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux 's alleged rocky relationship and it 's none other than Jen 's close friend , Chelsea Handler .
Is the former `` Friends '' star jealous because her new husband and her pal are getting too close ?
Quite the opposite .
A source claimed that Justin allegedly ca n't stand Chelsea and her antics .
`` Recently , Justin came home to find Chelsea cooking breakfast in their kitchen ... completely naked , '' Celeb Dirty Laundry '' But Justin Theroux has forbidden her from having any more naked romps in his house while he is out of town , '' the report continued .
According to an insider , Chelsea Handler was allegedly just trying to be funny .
Unfortunately , Justin Theroux was n't laughing .
Apparently , Theroux confronted Aniston about her friend and how she irritates him .
`` Chelsea thought it was hilarious , but Justin was really annoyed .
Apparently Jen got in the habit of inviting Chelsea over for boozy girls ' nights whenever he was away filming , '' OK !
Magazine '' It bugged him to come home and find Chelsea there and the house a mess , but he bit his tongue .
But now that he and Jen are married , he is establishing some ground rules , chief among them is that Chelsea is no longer welcome in their guest room , '' the report said .
It has been previously reported that the newly weds are allegedly having problems over Jennifer Aniston being jealous because of Justin 's purported closeness with his `` The Leftovers '' co-star , Margaret Qualley .
The newlyweds ' friends are hoping that the couple work out their differences especially since the couple is allegedly in the process of adopting a baby .
Comey Lawyer : No memos given to me were marked classified
The Columbia University Law School professor and confidant of former FBI Director James Comey refuted a charge by President Donald Trump and his advocates in the media Monday : that Comey shared classified information with journalists .
Daniel Richman , with whom Comey shared at least one memo -- the contents of which Richman shared with New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt -- said President Trump was simply wrong .
`` No memo was given to me that was marked 'classified , ' '' Daniel Richman told CNN .
`` No memo was passed on to the Times .
`` Richman did share the contents of one memo , he said , but `` the substance of the memo passed on to the Times was not marked classified and to my knowledge remains unclassified .
`` During Senate testimony in June , in which he said he gave memos to someone he described as a Columbia University professor , Comey said he specifically wrote the memos to avoid including classified information .
`` My thinking was , if I write it in such a way that I do n't include anything that would trigger a classification , that 'll make it easier for us to discuss , within the FBI and the government , and to -- to hold on to it in a way that makes it accessible to us , '' Comey told senators .
On Sunday , writing in The Hill , John Solomon reported that , `` More than half of the memos former FBI Director James Comey wrote as personal recollections of his conversations with President Trump about the Russia investigation have been determined to contain classified information , according to interviews with officials familiar with the documents .
`` CNN has not independently verified The Hill 's report .
The Hill 's reporting raised `` the possibility , '' Solomon reported , that `` Comey broke his own agency 's rules and ignored the same security protocol '' that Comey criticized Hillary Clinton for disregarding .
Solomon did not report that the possible breaking of FBI rules was determined to have happened , nor did he report that this would be a violation of the law .
Yet that is how President Trump depicted it in a tweet Monday morning : `` James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media .
That is so illegal !
`` One of the issues at play may have to do with whether any contents of the Comey memos have since been upgraded to classified , although that has not been definitively reported by CNN .

Robert Mueller Wiretapped The Trump White House
Will this outrage stand ?
Today 's breaking story of the DOJ surveilling the communications of POTUS Trump 's longtime personal attorney is just now filtering through news watchers across the country .
Remember , the Cohen surveillance was referred to by Special Counsel Robert Mueller , ( and signed off by the DOJ 's # 2 Rod Rosenstein who was the one who originally pushed for President Trump to fire then FBI Director James Comey ) meaning it was effectively Mueller 's operation .
And what THAT means is Robert Mueller was wiretapping the Trump White House .
THIS HAS NEVER BEEN ALLOWED BEFORE .
Early reports indicate at least one direct phone call between President Trump and Cohen was surveilled/recorded .
In a normal world , as soon as the President of the United States was on the line , the DOJ would have initiated an all stop on surveillance .
That has been long-standing ( albeit unofficial ) protocol for decades .
That did n't happen which would indicate capturing the President 's communications to Cohen was the primary purpose of the Mueller-originating surveillance all along .
Consider this that the Department of Justice is charged with upholding the powers of the Constitution but in this case ( and likely many-many others ) it has shredded those same Constitutional protections in order to bring down a duly-elected President of the United States .
When will enough Americans finally stand up and say ENOUGH ?
This is no longer merely about President Trump .
It is n't about Democrat or Republican , liberal or conservative .
This is about America , our personal liberties , and the now-fractured foundation that was the Constitution .
For if the government can go after a sitting president via such questionable/illegal means it can come after any of us at any time .
Hear that knock at your door ? It 's for you .

The FBI Reportedly Wiretapped Trump 's Campaign Chair , And It 's A Big Deal
Another day , another uncomfortably shady revelation about Donald Trump 's presidential campaign and possible connections to Russia .
This time , it 's the news that FBI investigators wiretapped Trump campaign chair Paul ManafortSeveral sources told CNN that the intelligence which the investigation collected included communications that `` sparked concerns… that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign , '' though at least two sources specifically added that the evidence was n't conclusive .
Manafort was surveilled under a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) warrant , which must be backed with information showing suspicion that the subject could be acting as an agent of a foreign power .
The warrant must be approved by top officials in the FBI and the Department of Justice .
Notably , there 's a big piece of the puzzle missing .
CNN reports that the FBI was not surveilling Manafort during the now-infamous meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyerManafort was originally investigated for his alleged shady dealings with former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych , who was at the head of a pro-Russian party which was driven out in 2014 by civil unrest and street protests .
Manafort 's firm was accused of lobbying for Yanukovychwhy Manafort left the Trump campaignCNN 's sources said that the second warrant , the start date of which is unknown , was based on efforts to investigate possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian agents .
So basically , for the first warrant there needed to be suspicion that Manafort was dealing with the Ukrainians ( which , yeah , he wasOn the other hand , the report also gives some near-credibility to Trump 's old claim that former President Barack Obama was wiretapping him ( and by `` credibility , '' I mean you have to tilt your head and squint to `` see '' it ) .
Back in March , Trump tweeted an accusation that Obama had wiretapped him at his residence at his eponymous Trump Tower shortly before the 2016 election , calling the former president `` sick. ``
Representatives of both Obama and the Department of Justice said that the claims were baselessWhile Manafort keeps a residence at Trump Tower , there is still no evidence Trump himself was under surveillance .
Which , however , does n't mean he was n't picked up by the surveillance on Manafort .
CNN notes that Trump and Manafort continued to communicate for months after Manafort left the campaign , even after the FBI investigation into the former campaign manager became public knowledge .
The conversations reportedly continued until lawyers for both men `` insisted they stop .
`` Special counsel Robert Mueller , who is leading the investigation into Russian interference in the election , reportedly told Manafort in July that the investigation planned to indict himA physical search warrant is unusual for someone whose lawyer has already been in touch with the Justice Department , as Manafort 's has been — and is an indicator that prosecutors had probable cause to believe that the home contained evidence of a crime , and were concerned about destruction of evidence .
As former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurulé told the Times , `` clearly they did n't trust him .
`` So , it 's not looking good for old Paul , here .
To say the least .
The NRA CEO 's Response To Las Vegas Shooting Was Incredibly Tone-Deaf
Last Sunday , a frightfully organized lone gunman opened fire on a crowd of 22,000 people at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas .
In his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel , he had 23 guns , some of which were outfitted with bump stocks ( devices which allow semi-automatic weapons the capability to mimic the gunfire of automatic weapons ) .
He killed 58 people and injured 527 before being discovered , killing himself before police could apprehend him .
In the wake of the worst mass shooting in modern United States history , the NRA CEO 's response to the Las Vegas shootingRomper has reached out to the NRA and is awaiting a reply .
NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre , normally a man who keeps a low profile , offered a rare interview with Fox News on Thursday .
While he did call the Las Vegas shooting an `` unimaginable tragedy '' during his interview , LaPierre insisted that stricter gun laws If legislation worked , Boston massacre would n't have worked , San Bernardino where California has every gun law on the books , that would n't have happened .
LaPierre went on to quickly accuse the `` other side '' of the tragedy ; notably Democrats and celebrities who have been vehemently calling for gun control legislation .
The NRA CEO lashed out and accused them of trying to politicize a tragedy , and attempting `` to piggyback their whole agenda to ban guns , restrict law abiding people for the last 20 years , this circus , on the back of this tragedy .
`` The CEO became especially agitated when discussing what he believes to be the double standard coming out of Hollywood : We spend millions of dollars every year , teaching people safety and responsibility , and this Hollywood crowd makes billions teaching gun irresponsibility to the American public .
The hypocrisy is beyond belief .
Of course , LaPierre does n't have actual facts to back up those claims , and it 's important to remember that he is talking about fictional depictions in action movies .
When LaPierre accused those unnamedHere are a few real-life statistics about gun use in America : firearms in the United Statescivilian-owned firearmsAmericans own more gunsHowever badly LaPierre would like to shift the focus from the Las Vegas shooting victims to his personal vendetta against Hollywood action films , it ca n't happen .
The reality is , the families of those victims need a real , informed , empathetic response to the mass shooting .
Not a distraction .
Because they are real people who lost real loved ones at the hands of a man with real guns .
This is n't a movie .
It 's real life .

This video of waves crashing directly into a house shows the danger and power of Hurricane Matthew 's flooding
One of the biggest problems officials face in preparing for a hurricane is that many people simply ignore evacuation orders .
As Hurricane Matthew bore down on Florida this week before tearing up the coastline Friday , Rick Scott begged Floridians in evacuation zones to flee .
`` This storm will kill you , '' he said .
But , inevitably , some people do n't .

Trump 's anti-Muslim tweets : Pathological racism or severe mental decline ?
There 's been a lot of talk this week about President Trump 's mental state .
Psychiatrists have weighed inreportTrump 's TwitterBut there was one series of tweets that stood out and it 's so bad that it may have actually caused a diplomatic break with our closest ally .
On Thursday morning , for some inexplicable reason , the president of the United States retweeted three videos claiming to be Muslim extremists perpetrating violence .
One purported to show a group of Muslims pushing a boy off a roof , another claimed to show a Muslim destroying a statue of the Virgin Mary and a third supposedly showed a Muslim immigrant hitting a Dutch boy on crutches .
The Dutch embassy clarified that the third video actually of two native-born dutch boys fighting , and did not involve Muslim immigrants at all .
The tweets were from a vile British neofascist named Jayda Fransen , the deputy leader of a tiny far-right , anti-immigrant group called Britain First .
You may recall that prior to the Brexit vote last year a Labour Party member of Parliament named Jo Cox was assassinated by a man who shouted the words `` Britain First '' before he killed her .
According to the Daily Beast : The group had previously struggled to garner mainstream-media coverage of their video stunts , which include mosque `` invasions '' and `` Christian patrols '' during which uniformed thugs carrying white crosses attempt to intimidate minority citizens .
On Wednesday , Trump catapulted Fransen and the group 's leader Paul Golding , who is also a convicted criminal , into the global conversation .
Trump sent those videos out to his millions of followers ; hundreds of millions more may have seen them through other social media and mainstream news by now .
These anti-Muslim videos are the worst kind of hate propaganda , the kind of thing one expects to find deep in the bowels of the extremist right-wing internet .
Needless to say , Fransen was delighted and thanked TrumpThe reaction was swift .
Prime Minister Theresa May 's office rebuked the presidentTrump himself was not contrite , of course .
He responded this way : .
@ Theresa_May— Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 30 , 2017London Mayor Sadiq Khan saidTrump 's state of mindWe are all well aware of Trump 's bond with the old-fashioned American far right .
David Duke is a big fan and applauded himBreitbart International media ventureWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later that Trump did not know who Jayda Fransen was before he retweeted her , and claimed he was trying to `` elevate the issue '' He has been retweeting white supremacists and neofascists for a long timeMay did not rescind the invitation to the state visit .
But the British do n't seem to be in any hurry to set a date either .

Air Force Chief Staff ‘ Classifies ' TRUMP as Enemy of America
As we are writing this , Donald Trump is clothed in his war regalia as he prepares for a battle with the judiciary , the press , the CIA and probably innocent Americans .
The good news is that we have a powerful and high-ranking military officer is not going to let Trump oppress the world .
Air Force Chief of Staff Dave Goldfein may not have called Trump out directly , but his words are pointed at the president .
In his interview with the press , Goldfein did n't spare words of wisdom that Trump should better listen to .
Earlier this week , President Trump aka ‘ Orange Tyrant ' was at the MacDill Air Force Base to give his ridiculous and meaningless speeches .
Imagine what he told the military officers who left what they should be doing to listen to him if they do n't like him , he is not going to like them .
Goldfein said that the oath they too and they always retake every time they were promoted was to defend and support the American Constitution against any enemy both in the domestic and foreign arena .
By design , these military officers do not pledge to defend or support any leader or party because they are apolitical .
The military is not too friendly with the president according to Goldfein , one day ; the military may be protecting the people from Trump .
Goldfein indirectly criticized the disastrous raid in Yemen authorized by Trump , the assurance of Trump that the SEAL was going to have a field only pointed out that he was a local fish without the experience of swimming in the international waters .
One of the things that Goldfein is proud of is the fact that the military can not lose sight that they go to war with their values .
People who are critical of the efforts that the military undertakes each day to stop causalities are not aware of who the military are .
Indeed , Goldfein is a true patriot who defends the real values of American .
We are happy with the service that he is offering passionately to our country to ensure that our ideals are maintained .
It does n't look like the upper class of the military really like Trump .
They have rejected the requested Trump made for the military to go for the fascist-style military parade for his Inauguration Day .
Americans need patriots like Goldfein .
It is time for each one of us to stand up .
I 'm talking about the timing ' : Joe Scarborough suggests assault allegations against Trump were coordinated
MSNBC host Joe Scarborough expressed wariness on Thursday morning about the timing and source of the recent slew of sexual assault allegationsThe `` Morning Joe '' host speculated that allegations by multiple women in publications such as People magazine , The New York Times , BuzzFeed , and the Palm Beach Post may have been coordinated by Hillary Clinton 's campaign .
He argued that sexual assault victims would have had months to come forward with allegations , and cited Trump 's inflammatory comments about Fox News host Megyn Kelly as a potential `` triggering event. ``
.
@ JoeNBChttps : //t .
co/lQ2gP5QD99October 13 , 2016 '' I 'm talking about the timing of all of this dropping , talk about an October surprise , '' Scarborough said .
`` There have been 1,000 triggering events that would have made sense .
If I had been sexually harassed by this man , the Megyn Kelly story would have given me and opportunity .
`` He added : `` There have been 1,000 reports of this already .
I 'm just asking why all the sudden this stuff is dropping in October .
Perhaps it 's all innocent .
Perhaps there 's no oppo drop .
Perhaps it 's not coordinated .
`` The allegations come after a 2005 video was released on FridayDuring the second presidential debate , Trump denied that he ever sexually assaulted women .
The Trump campaign is already pushing back against the allegations .
Trump 's attorneys sent a letter to the New York Times early Thursday morning denying the allegations and threatening to sue the paper for defamationThe real-estate magnate also took to Twitter to defend himself .

Here 's What Happened When a Drunk Driver Pulled a Gun on a Police Officer
It 's not often that a suspect 's attorney calls the police officer who arrested him a `` true hero ; '' but in John Picerno 's eyes , that exactly what Overland Park Police Sergeant Scott Ferguson is .
Back in April , Ferguson was on night patrol when he spotted a vehicle driving along the wrong side of road with no headlights on .
He pulled the car over , but the driver quickly took off again…only to crash into a fire hydrant .
Dash cam footage from Ferguson 's patrol car then shows the drunk driver exiting his vehicle .
He stood there hunched over with his hands behind his back , until Ferguson began approaching .
That 's when the driver pulled out a pistol .
Rather than brandishing his own weapon , Ferguson wrestled the gun out of the driver 's hands - and the driver to the ground where he was finally handcuffed .
At his hearing in August , the suspect pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and battery on a law enforcement officer , as well as driving under the influence .
After serving 170 days of his sentence , he was placed on probation .
But according to Picerno , his lawyer , he should just be thankful he 's alive .
`` He is very lucky and both he and his family are very grateful for the officer , Sgt .
Scott Ferguson , who exercised extreme discretion during the incident , '' Picerno said according to the Kansas City StarHe added that Ferguson likely would 've been justified in firing his weapon in that situation .
`` No one is tougher on law enforcement than me , '' he continued .
`` I have to say Sgt .
Ferguson is a true hero in my book .
He is an example of what good policing looks like .
`` We could n't agree more .

Trump says NFL owners should fire players who kneel for national anthem
President Donald Trump criticized some in the National Football League Friday night at a rally for Alabama Republican Senate candidate Luther StrangeTrump added that if fans would `` leave the stadium '' when players kneel in protest during the national anthem , `` I guarantee , things will stop .
`` Trump said NFL owners should respond to the players by saying , `` Get that son of a b**** off the field right now , he 's fired .
He 's fired !
`` Unable to play video .
HTML5 is not supported !
`` For a week , ( that owner would ) be the most popular person in this country .
Because that 's a total disrespect of our heritage .
That 's a total disrespect for everything we stand for , '' Trump said .
Last year , Colin Kaepernick -- formerly with the San Francisco 49ers , but currently without a team -- drew national attention for refusing to stand during `` The Star-Spangled Banner '' prior to kickoff .
`` I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color , '' Kaepernick told NFL Media in August 2016 .
His protest spurred both support and backlash .
Following the events in Charlottesville , Virginia , where white supremacists gathered to protest the removal of a Confederate soldier statue , Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett told CNN '' I ca n't stand for the national anthem , '' Bennett said .
`` I ca n't stand right now .
I 'm not going to be standing until I see the equality and freedom .
`` Trump also took aim at NFL efforts to prevent concussions .
`` They 're ruining the game , right ? ''
he said .
`` They 're ruining the game. ``
New video shows struggle in Huntington Beacch officer-involved shooting
HUNTINGTON BEACH ( FOX 11 / CNS ) - New video has emerged showing what happened before the shooting took place that left a man dead in Huntington Beach on Friday .
A Huntington Beach police officer fatally shot a suspect outside a 7-Eleven store Friday in a confrontation that was caught on video and posted online .
WARNING : VIDEO CONTAINS GRAPHIC IMAGES AND CONTENTThe shooting occurred about 9:30 a. m. outside the store at 6012 Edinger Ave. , where the suspect got into a scuffle with the officer just before the shooting , according to a Huntington Beach Police Department spokeswoman .
The suspect later died at a hospital , police said .
It happened fast , and like most everything these days , was captured on cell phone video by a bystander .
A Huntington Beach Police Officer , in a violent struggle with a man outside a 7-11 .
The officer , a few feet away , takes aim with his handgun and fires , once ... twice ... 7 times .
The suspect at first takes the shots standing up , then crumbles to the ground .
It 's quite graphic , quite real , and quite dramatic .
In fact , we do n't even want to show it on TV it 's that violent .
The suspect would later die at a hospital and per protocol , the Orange County Sheriff is taking over the investigation .
What made this all the more scary was that diagonally across the street is Marina High School .
Police ordered it `` locked down '' and immediately cell phones lit up with texts and emails between parents , students , and administrators .
There was confusion and near panic among some over reports that there was an active shooter on campus , which there was not .
Why ?
Well , it appears that the shooting happened adjacent to a shopping center called 'Marina Village ' .
On campus there 's an area referred to as `` The Village '' , so reports of a shooting in `` The Village '' or at `` The Village '' led to understandable confusion .
Yet one of the benefits of social media and that fact that every student has a cell phone , is that the accurate story got out there quickly and students and parents worst fears were calmed within minutes .
Cell phone video of the shooting was posted on Twitter

Imran Awan Had a Secret Server that Was Connected to the House Democratic Caucus
A clearer picture is coming into focus on the Democrat IT scandal that may help explain why Democrats have been so reluctant to condemn the Awans or help the police with the investigation .
It also might explain why former DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so jumpyNew information about a massive cybersecurity breach , gleaned from a senior House official with direct knowledge of the investigation , implicates the former chair of the House Democratic Caucus , then-Rep. Xavier Becerra , who is now the attorney general of California and a rising star in Democratic politics .
Xavier Becerra was told by cops his server had major cybersecurity issues re : Imran .
A fake server was given to cops He 's remained silent .
September 13 , 2017This scandal is n't about bank fraud , folks .
Kudos to Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller for chasing down this story , even as the Democratic media complex either poo-pooed or ignored the growing scandal .
As Ace of Spades A secret server is behind law enforcement 's decision to ban a former IT aide to Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz from the House network .
Now-indicted former congressional IT aide Imran Awan allegedly routed data from numerous House Democrats to a secret server .
Police grew suspicious and requested a copy of the server early this year , but they were provided with an elaborate falsified image designed to hide the massive violations .
The falsified image is what ultimately triggered their ban from the House network Feb. 2 , according to a senior House official with direct knowledge of the investigation .
The secret server was connected to the House Democratic Caucus , an organization chaired by then-Rep. Xavier Becerra .
Police informed Becerra that the server was the subject of an investigation and requested a copy of it .
Authorities considered the false image they received to be interference in a criminal investigation , the senior official said .
Data was also backed up to Dropbox in huge quantities , the official said .
Congressional offices are prohibited from using Dropbox , so an unofficial account was used , meaning Awan could have still had access to the data even though he was banned from the congressional network .
Awan had access to all emails and office computer files of 45 members of Congress who are listed below .
Fear among members that Awan could release embarrassing information if they cooperated with prosecutors could explain why the Democrats have refused to acknowledge the cybersecurity breach publicly or criticize the suspects .
According to the DCNF 's source , the Awans ' use of Dropbox went well beyond casual use .
They were `` funneling of huge quantities of data offsite where it could not be taken back by House authorities. ``
Are All Men Supposed To Be Financially Buoyant ? Lady Warns Women Who Broke-Shame Men
A lady identified as Monisola ( @ Monaayy ) , has taken to the social networking platform to talk down on women who are in the habit of broke-shaming men .
There is a mentality in this part of the world which has led to a lot of unrealistic expectations from women who believe it is their entitlement to be taken care of and to be with a wealthy men and as a result of this , they tend to look down on struggling men .
The lady who appears to be fed up with this mentality , took to the online platform to share her opinion concerning the issue .
She wrote : '' I 'm sick of broke shaming .
It is obnoxious and cruel .
To expect a man to be financially buoyant simply because he 's a man is just as offensive as expecting a woman to cook and clean simply because she 's a woman .
Not every man has deep pockets .
`` `` If we 're kicking against patriarchal norms then we ca n't *expect* men to be rich because they 're men , especially if you as a woman do n't even have your own money !
That 's a disgraceful double standard .
If you do n't want the validity of your womanhood to be evaluated based on your domestic prowess , then stop devaluing men for being `` broke '' .
`` Everyone is on their personal journey .
He 'll get there when he gets there .
If you do n't want to date a man without money , fine , you have every right to make that choice .
But do n't shame him for his financial status .
`` That is cruel .
Money does not grow on trees .
I even see women shaming men for being in the exact same financial position as them and honestly I 'm embarrassed .
Do n't be hungry please .
`` The post which went viral on social media , received several reactions from people who seemed to be in agreement with her post .

Watch Jimmy Kimmel Help Voters Process Donald Trump 's Victory
Jimmy KimmelDonald TrumpThe first stage in the process is denial , which Kimmel summarized as `` no , the host of Celebrity Apprentice ca n't possibly be our president , CNN must have the math wrong. ``
After that comes the anger stage : `` Who do I blame for this ? ''
Kimmel wondered .
`` Bernie ?
The FBI ?
Gary Johnson ?
Jill Stein ? ''
`` How is it possible that half the country is too busy to even vote ? ''
he continued .
`` They all managed to play Pokémon Go .
`` After getting that out of his system , Kimmel moved on to the third stage : bargaining .
`` Maybe this needed to happen to wake up everyone up , '' he reasoned .
`` Maybe this is a good thing .
Maybe he 'll only build the wall waist high , to keep short people out. ``
This rationalization period was quickly followed by depression , `` where you get a spoon and you just eat peanut butter out of the jar .
`` Finally , many jars of peanut butter later , Kimmel suggested that tearful voters will eventually reach acceptance - possibly with the aid of some narcotics .
`` No matter how you feel about it , Donald Trump is the president of the United States of America , '' Kimmel said .
`` So thank god we legalized marijuana yesterday .
`` California passed Proposition 64 , a law legalizing recreational marijuana .

Judge Responds To Man 's Request For Sharia Law
A Muslim man was shocked to have his request for a judge to acknowledge Sharia law denied in court .
Nadir Ibrahim Ombabi , a Minnesota taxi driver , was killed in a car accident .
Following his passing , legal proceedings began to determine a settlement for his spouse or surviving family .
A wrongful death suit was filed , in which Ombabi 's estate was rewarded $ 183,000 to go to his wife .
Ombabi 's brother , Hasameldin Ibrahim Imbabi , subsequently disputed the ruling on the grounds that the money should be distributed to his family in accordance with Sharia law .
One of the specifics of that argument was that the men should receive `` twice the share of the female .
`` `` [ The brother ] further asserts that `` the principles of the private international law should have been applied from the beginning since the law of all parties ( the decedent , his widow and decedent [ ‘ s ] next of kin ) is the Islamic Law and they are all Muslims and follow the specifics of the religion. ``
… [ The brother 's ] main assertion of error appears to be that the district court should have applied Sudanese Islamic law instead of Minnesota law when distributing the wrongful-death settlement proceeds… .
[ He ] also asserts that the district court erred by refusing to honor a legal declaration issued by the Sudanese Family Court in Khartoum regarding distribution of the wrongful-death settlement proceeds under Sudanese Islamic law , '' court documents stated , the Washington Post reported .
The judge , however , denied the man 's argument due to lack of legal representation and specious arguments .
Many reader applauded the judge 's decision to reject Sharia law .
`` Muslim man has no grounds to stand on with that , Sharia Law has NO place in this country ... these people need to get it through their thick skull that the US Constitution which is law of our land and Sharia Law does not and can not co-exist in our land ! ''
one Newsiosity reader commented on the site 's Facebook page .
`` Welcome to America .
If you want to immigrate here and live here then follow our laws and rules .
`` When in Rome Do as the Romans Do `` You are in our country .
.
respect the laws here or go back to your original country .
This an example of what is totally wrong with this country now Everyone who comes here wants America to accommodate them and expect us to change .
Not happening , '' another added .
Anonymous Denies Claim They Hacked Neo-Nazi Website Daily Stormer
Anonymous have denied claims that they hacked the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer , after a post appeared claiming that the hacktivist group was `` now in control '' of the site .
A post titled ‘ END OF HATE : ANONYMOUS NOW IN CONTROL OF DAILY STORMER ' appeared on the far-right site earlier this morning , suggesting that Anonymous were going to bring an end to The Daily Stormer following the events of the Charlottesville `` Unite The Right '' rally , which saw white nationalists converge to protest plans to remove a Confederate statue .
The rally led to multiple conflicts between the nationalists and counter-protesters , ultimately leading to the death of civil rights activist Heather Heyer , who was one of many hit by a vehicle driven by white supremacist James Alex Fields .
Many outlets reported that Anonymous had infiltrated The Daily Stormer website in response to the events of Charlottesville , with the post on the site reading : `` WE HAVE TAKEN THIS SITE IN THE NAME OF HEATHER HEYER A VICTIM OF WHITE SUPREMACIST TERRORISM .
FOR TOO LONG THE DAILY STORMER AND ANDREW ANGLIN HAVE SPEWED THEIR PUTRID HATE ON THIS SITE .

However , Anonymous have stated that they believe the post was made by The Daily Stormer in a `` stunt '' designed to `` woo their clueless base .

Dez Bryant announces Cowboys ' plans for national anthem

Anti-Gun Crusader Admits What We Already Knew
When the discussion of gun control rears its ugly head , some well-meaning proponent of `` common sense gun measures '' invariably tells us that no one wants to take our guns .
They swear that they only want the `` bad '' guns .
Maybe they 'll say , `` No one needs an assault rifle '' but if you mention bans on bolt action guns or handguns , they start backing up with their hands in supplication .
`` No , no , no , no .
No one wants to do anything about those , '' he 'll say .
That means he 's either wrong or lying Democratic politicians have been brainwashed by political hacks like me to begin all of their statements about guns by declaring support for the Second Amendment and a deep affinity for the cultures of hunters and sportsmen—even if they themselves have never fired weapons .
We call them `` gun safety '' proposals instead of `` gun control '' measures because pollsters and consultants divined that `` gun safety '' would be less alarming to gun voters , and that gun voters were to be coddled at all cost .
The Democratic gun control strategy fails because it is defined by this poverty of ambition—the determination never to look beyond fear of political repercussions .
Universal background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazines are good ideas and we should seize the opportunity to enact them if it presents itself .
But they wo n't come anywhere close to making gun violence in America a tolerable problem .
We are nibbling around the edges instead of proposing bold , meaningful solutions such as : according to a 2016 studyThese proposals are essentially omitted from the national conversation largely because Democrats are scared that the NRA will spin them disingenuously to inflame gun owners .
Again , Democrats presume their hand is the weaker of the two .
Last week , Republicans rejoiced , and some Democrats winced privately , when Nancy Pelosi saidWritten by former Obama staffer Dan Pfeiffer who seems absolutely in love with gun control .
After all , he calls for a national gun buyback program similar to Australia 's but fails to inform his readers that the buyback was simply a more palatable gun confiscation program masquerading as choice .
Then again , this is the guy who says this , followed by claiming , `` Republicans currently control every branch of government and the NRA is still producing agitpropThe entire post is nothing more than a paper dedicated to trying to convince Democrats that the answer to guns is to move even more to the left on guns , to stop pretending that they do n't want all the guns , yet he has the nerve to blame the NRA for producing videos ?
It should be noted that the video he chose is the one where Dana Loesch calls out the leftist media for lying .
It actually does n't say a thing about how Democrats want all the guns .
Not that it matters to someone like Pfeiffer .
All that matters is that Democrats are n't being honest about coming after all of our guns .
He 's annoyed they wo n't be honest , but I 'm going to let Dan know something .
We already know they want them all , and that 's why no one is backing down .
Especially since none of his proposals would have stopped Las Vegas .
The Las Vegas Shooting and the Attack of the Carrion Crows
When I was fourteen or sixteen - pardon me , but I do n't remember precisely , nor did these things make any impression in the international mainstream media - mom and I went to what was probably an illegal demonstration in downtown Porto , Portugal .
No , I am not sure if it was illegal , or even honestly what the demonstration was for .
Around that time it might have been for anything , including in support of whoever was the most right-wing candidate available .
( Do n't get excited .
It was never further to the right than social democrat , and at one time it was the socialist candidate .
) What I remember of that demonstration — one in a string of them — were the shots from above .
If my memory serves me ( and understand that after these many years things run together , but be patient , there 's a point to this ) , the demonstration was in Avenida dos Aliados , which despite the name is a plaza , hemmed in between tallish , nineteenth/early twentieth century stone buildings .
I 'd guess from memory four or five stories high .
The shots came from either the upper windows or the roof of one of these buildings .
As someone in the crowd , I remember people startled , starting to move , eddies in the packed multitude , and then someone ahead of us going down , bloodied .
At that point , the running started .
I do n't know how I ended up running near a wall ( we were pretty much in the center of the space ) but I remember the moment a hand shot out , grabbed me , and pressed me flat against the wall .
The shots continued through this , btw .
The person who grabbed me was my mom , and for the next few minutes , we resisted the crowd going by so close they might pull us with them .
I do n't remember how many people were shot .
Maybe four .
Far more died in running down an underground passage , trying to get away/to the train station .
That last is what my mom saved me from .
This is also why my blood boiled this morning when Hillary Clinton ran her ill-informed , loud mouth about the shooting in Las Vegas .
We 'll leave alone the fact that the `` silencer '' does n't indeed render guns silent .
Larry Correia covered that recently in a wonderful post at his blogBut even if it were possible to silence shots completely , would it be a bad thing , to prevent panic and the subsequent trampling ? Unfortunately , Hillary Clinton was n't the only person speaking while wearing a stylish colon hat .
Facebook and probably all the news media — I 'm working on a book and at any rate have no intention of subjecting my blood pressure to that kind of hammering — are full of `` experts '' and `` observers '' and `` commenters '' talking about how this would n't have happened if we had only banned private gun ownership .
Terry Crews Shares Story Of How He Was Sexually Assaulted By Hollywood Executive
Actor Terry Crews has taken to social media to share his experience with sexual assault in Hollywood .
The 49-year-old Brooklyn Nine-Nine star told his story as more allegations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein were made public .
Crews alleges that another 'Hollywood honcho ' touched him inappropriately in 2016 .
In a Twitter thread tonight , he wrote : `` This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD .
Why ?
Because this kind of thing happened to ME .
My wife [ and ] I were at a Hollywood function last year [ and ] a high level Hollywood executive came over 2 me and groped my privates .
`` Jumping back I said What are you doing ? !
My wife saw everything [ and ] we looked at him like he was crazy .
He just grinned like a jerk .
`` I was going to kick his ass right then - but I thought twice about how the whole thing would appear .
'240 lbs .
Black man stomps out Hollywood Honcho ' would be the headline the next day .
`` Only I probably would n't have been able to read it because I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN JAIL .
So we left .
`` Crews added that he told everyone he knew and worked with about what happened to him .
And that the executive called him the next day to apologise , but never explained his reason for the assault .
He said he never took it further , as we would be `` ostracized , [ which is ] par for the course when the predator has power and influence .
Who 's going to believe you ?

Book on Chicana Activists Honors The Women History Has Ignored
In Chicano history , the women who formed a vital part of social justice movements have often been swept aside ; forgotten or ignored as their male counterparts receive the bulk of the praise for their collective work .
Their visibility is imperative as Chicanas continue to work in social justice , fighting the good fights within various movements .
The book documents the experiences of 61 Chicanas from the '60s to the present who have paved the way in the fight for human rights as educators , attorneys , activists , artists and more .
Some of the women featured have passed , while others remain active .
Each of their stories were written by an author of their or their loved ones ' choosing , creating beautiful pieces that bring together women for the purpose of honoring women .
The project came about by the Chicano Archive Committee at San Diego State University , which works to document the people and historical events that have occurred around the Chicano movement .
Committee members and co-editors Sonia Lopez and Rita Sanchez selected the women featured in `` Chicana Tributes '' to document what they believe is missing from the history books .
Lopez , a longtime activist and educator , was the first person to teach a Chicana history class at San Diego State back in 1972 .
Back then , she found a need to address Chicana issues , and still sees the need today .
`` There 's still not enough information on Chicanas that have contributed to history , society and the community , '' she says .
`` They need to be recognized .
`` Among the women featured are ACLU leader Norma Chavez , Laura Rodriguez , matriarch of the National Historic Landmark Chicano Park , Charlotte Hernandez Terry , the first woman to paint a mural at Chicano Park , and Delia Moreno , who along with her daughters form Trio Moreno , which played protest trio music during important events in the Chicano movement .
`` It 's amazing that these women still had the courage and resilience in spite of all their hardships , '' Lopez says .
`` We 're trying to teach people this is life .
Life is a struggle .
Part of becoming who you are is a struggle .
And for us , especially , as Mexicanas on this side of the border .
We chose the word ‘ chicana ' to define our own identity , tell our history , tell our story and tell our roots .
By reading this story people will learn , people will appreciate and feel inspired .
`` `` I think young women today are looking for role models , '' she adds .
`` I do n't feel that we have enough role models out there of people that are doing things or have done things to inspire , to motivate .
With this book , young women can see that it 's possible to do .
The groundwork has been laid by the women featured in this book .

What Do Background Checks Do To Crime Rates ? Not What Some Think
Despite the fact that the Las Vegas shooter would have passed any an all background checks , some on the left still think background checks will somehow solve all of our ills in this country .
They 're absolutely convinced that universal background checks will miraculously keep guns out of the hands of not just criminals , but also the man who may someday open fire on an unsuspecting crowd enjoying some music .
However , what they think will happen and what actually occurs tends to be rather dissimilar But such expanded background checks would n't have stopped any of these attacks .
Since 2000 , all of our mass shooters obtained their weapons without using private transfers .
Attacks such as the San Bernardino massacre in California and the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon occurred in states that already have universal background checks .
Indeed , mass public shootings have recently occurred in France , Belgium , Norway , Germany and other European countries where these background checks also exist .
This hole in their argument is so glaring that even some of the media have noticed it .
Last year , ABC News 's Jon Karl askedChris MurphyResearch looking at U. S. data has consistently found no evidence that any type of background checks reduce rates of violent crime .
Michael Bloomberg 's groups are the source of contrary claims , but they fail to analyze the national data in an academic manner .
They compare states with background checks next to those without them .
They do not compare states before and after background checks are imposed .
The fact is that criminals have a pipeline for inexpensive black market guns that require no background checks either , as was illustrated by CBS in their report on Chicago gun crimeLet 's also face the fact that criminals are , by definition , lawbreakers .
They 're not concerned with whatever laws you pass because they 're already breaking so many , they figure , `` What 's one more ?
`` Despite claims by the leftists on social media , no one supports another massacre .
No one at all .
However , it does n't make any sense to make proposals that do nothing except inconvenience and burden law-abiding gun buyers who want to follow the law .
While I may disagree with Sen. Feinstein 's bump-fire stock ban proposal , at least that makes some sense in light of what we know from Las Vegas .
Universal background checks ?
Nope .
No sense at all .
Of course , why should anyone be surprised ?
These are the same people who still think banning guns will somehow ban violence in general while doing nothing about the underlying causes .
Right now , things are no different except they 're also trying to ban things that have no bearing on what happened , just because they figure the public will back it at the moment .
And I 've had people wonder why I call these people ghouls .
Harvey Weinstein Has Destroyed Hollywood -- Now What ?
Hollywood will not easily recover from Harvey Weinstein -- not for a long time .
The hypocrisy level has hit Defcon 1 , 9 .
9 on the Richter scale .
Hollywood 's politics have always been a self-serving charade , a liberal masquerade for a rapacious and lubricious lifestyle .
But now , thanks to the Weinstein scandal , we see it more clearly than ever .
And it could n't be more repellent .
( I had always thought Bill Clinton would have made the greatest studio executive of all time .
Now I 'm convinced of it .
) If conservative investors had any courage , this would be the time to make a hostile takeover of the movie business .
Unfortunately , they do n't .
I know this from bitter personal experience .
Wealthy conservatives are delighted to support the Philharmonic , but when it comes to popular culture they turn away , as if afraid to get their hands dirty .
The rot is everywhere , even , perhaps especially , in the precincts of `` high art. ``
Gwyneth Paltrow says now is the time to put an end to these attacks on women .
But where was she years ago when Harvey got `` handsy '' with her ?
Looking the other way while earning millions and garnering Oscars .
Meryl Streep claimed she was clueless about Weinstein 's repulsive antics .
Time to award her her greatest Oscar yet -- for playing someone deaf , dumb , and blind while living as a troglodyte in the Gobi desert .
Either the woman 's a liar or an utter nincompoop .
I 'll go with the former .
As for the great feminist George Clooney -- the first male star out of the box to condemn Weinstein 's behavior -- let 's give him the Nobel Prize in virtue signaling .
By coming forward , he was able to ace out his competition -- Howard Zinn-loving Matt Damon , who disgraced himself forever by covering up for Harvey a decade ago .
( For those who may have missed it in the onslaught of sleazy details , Damon assured then New York Times reporter Sharon Waxman that Miramax 's high-paid Italian representative was a genuine `` creative film executive '' and not Harvey 's European procurer , as was , evidently correctly , rumored .
Damon is the same `` progressive '' movie star who makes films opposing school choice for the masses while living in a thirty million dollar house and sending his kids to private school .
I take it back -- maybe we should give him the Nobel in virtue signaling . )
Here 's your leftover turkey : The case for Hillary Clinton 2020
Are you sick of Republicans ?
Or just right-wingers in general ?
Do you want to send a message to Washington that you are n't going to buy into their racistsexistxenophobichomophobicclassistThen do the very thing that Donald Trump unintentionally encouraged in a recent tweet : Encourage Hillary Clinton to run for president in 2020 !
Crooked Hillary Clinton is the worst ( and biggest ) loser of all time .
She just ca n't stop , which is so good for the Republican Party .
Hillary , get on with your life and give it another try in three years ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 18 , 2017I 'm sure this is the part where the Clinton-haters — be they Trumpers , Bernie Bros or anything in between — will say something to the effect of , `` Of course he wants her to run again .
That 's the only way he 'll get re-elected !
`` Slow your roll there .
Clinton 's poll numbers are n't too good right now ( OK , they 're downrightatrocious1 .
Hillary Clinton is the Winston Churchill to Vladimir Putin 's Adolf Hitler .
I agree with the basic principle of Godwin 's Law : The first person to invoke Hitler in a political debate should normally lose .
The exception , of course , has to be when someone has genuine Hitler-like qualities .
A foreign despot who has invaded neighboring countriesright-wing nationalist agendaThis is where Clinton offers a quality that no politician in America can beat .
While Republicans are trying to tar her with a bogus scandalinnate sexismpoliciespublicly criticizing Russian corruptionample connectionswater-carriers2 .
Hillary Clinton being elected president ( at last ) would monumentally piss off misogynistic trolls , and what 's not to like about that ? I ca n't think of a single political figure in recent American history who has been hated as deeply , or for as long , as Hillary Clinton .
From the moment she emerged on the national stage in 1992 as a distinctly feminist prospective first lady , she has been the target of right-wing wrath woefully out of proportion to anything she has ever said or done .
The reason for this is sexism .
It 's not the chic thing to say right now , but no other explanation really makes sense .
Yes , Hillary Clinton is more centrist than either party likes these days , but why is she singled out for opprobrium here when her husband — who actually served as president — remains popularAt the very least , the next Democratic presidential candidate needs to be a woman — perhaps not Clinton specifically , but certainly a woman , to offset the symbolic gut-punch of the first female candidate getting cheated3 .
By winning the popular vote convincingly in 2016 , Hillary Clinton has earned the right to be considered the presumptive nominee in 2020 .
As I wroteLet us not forget that , for all of the smack talk about how poorly Clinton ran her campaign , she bested Trump by nearly 3 million votes .
This was no razor-thin margin of victory , but a decisive expression of the American public 's preference .
In terms of percentage points , her margin of victory was roughly comparable to that by which Jimmy Carter beat Gerald Ford in 1976200420124 .
We can expect her to be a good president .
Frankly , the worst thing that can be said about a potential 2020 Clinton candidacy , especially in America 's current cultural and political climate , is that her husband still has n't answered for the numerous sexual abuse accusationsThen again , Bill Clinton is also widely associated with the economic , social and foreign policy conditions of the beloved 1990sFinally , and perhaps most importantly , Clinton demonstrated through the 2016 Democratic National Committee platformThat ability to get things done , by the way , is why Clinton had high approval ratings as secretary of state ( usually in the 60sbest served cold
Hollywood Actors Who Condemn Trump but Were Silent on Weinstein
Ashley Judd is the absolute worst .
I want to like her , I really do .
Sometimes she chooses a good cause , like speaking up for trafficked and abused children .
Those are the activities she should stick to .
Unfortunately , Judd had to go to the `` Women 's March , '' where hundreds of thousands of women wore pink `` pussy '' hats while claiming to be upset that Trump had used that word once .
She performed ridiculous slam poetry , screeching defamatory accusations about the president wanting to have sex with his daughter and about other terrible things about which she had no first-hand knowledge .
( You can watch the video below if you have the stomach for it .
) But at no time did she ever discuss a man who she did know did horrific things .
No `` by the way , Harvey Weinstein is a dirtbag who tried to get me to watch him shower for a part. ``
Why did n't that come up ? I find it very difficult to believe Judd is this angry at Donald Trump , a man who has never done anything to her , or provably to anybody , when there is a man who did do something horrible to her whom she could be screeching about .
She needs therapy .
And possibly tranquilizers .
Jennifer Lawrence was recently interviewed for her epic fail of a movie , Mother , and gave Democratic talking points like `` equality for women in the workplace , '' blamed Trump for hurricanes , and rattled off the same tired Leftist arguments we 've heard forever .
During another interview , she claimed that she is terrified of Trump and wanted to make a video of herself saying `` F*** you ! ''
to him .
Lawrence claimed she felt she could be a spokesperson for women who are underpaid : I felt like I had a voice , people look at me and listen to me , and to not say anything , that 's never sat well with me .
That seems disingenuous , because she kept quiet about the creepy mogul who everyone in Hollywood appears to have known was abusing women .
Why stay quiet over that ?
Do n't you have a responsibility to alert other women that there is a serial sexual predator in their midst ?
Lawrence has n't alleged any harassment from Weinstein , although she is seen looking awkward in many photos with him while he holds her too close to his massive girth .
It would n't surprise me if she had first-hand knowledge of his depravity .
Gwyneth Paltrow is the most apolitical in this list .
While she supported Obama , she never had anything more interesting to say beyond how handsome she thinks he is .
Mostly she spends her life divorcing people and selling outrageously priced trinkets to rich women online .
While she does n't fit in the category of commenting on Trump , she bears much responsibility in this scandal .
Let 's Talk About the Constitution - After Trump 's Win , We 're Going to Need It
Donald Trump rose to power by telling disaffected white people that the past represents the right and natural order .
Joe Raedle/GettyThe rise of President-elect Donald J. Trump is a triumph for white supremacy and misogyny that too many of us believed was impossible in the United States in 2016 .
Trump 's promise to `` Make America Great Again '' is a call to return us to a past in which white men of all classes could expect the government to protect their economic and social dominance relative to racial minorities and women .
It 's a harkening back to the `` greatness '' of a time when programs like the New Deal and the G. I .
Bill created a path to a middle-class life through government benefits that were systematically denied to black peoplelet black people live in your white apartment buildingsor dangerousonly white men were judgeswere presumed guilty and faced executiontreat women 's bodies as their propertyattractivenesssubserviencerobotsTrump rose to power by telling disaffected white people that the past represents the right and natural order , and he can bring it back .
He made no secret of who he would take our country back from : minorities , women , immigrants , Muslims , Jews .
And despite his open disdain for the rule of law , he often justified his mission by invoking the language the reactionary right has long used to describe their quest to turn back time : `` restoring the Constitution .
`` It is imperative that we stop letting the right own the Constitution .
Given that we 're about to have a president with dictatorial aspirations , and both houses of Congress controlled by the Republican Party from which he sprangBut for that to happen , liberals are going to have to stop letting the right 's claims to constitutional authority for their preferred social order go unanswered .
Too often , liberals and progressives treat the Constitution as an obsolete document written by white men who enslaved black people and treated women as property that has little relevance to our modern battles .
In doing so , we 've ceded the ground to white men longing for the good ol ' days .
Yes , the Constitution was written by white guys who got a lot very wrong , and it would indeed be a bankrupt document if it were frozen in time .
But while the Founders lacked the empathy or courage to recognize that `` We the People '' includes people of all colors , religions and genders , they enshrined revolutionary principles of what liberty entails and left room for us to interpret and amend the document to be more in keeping with those principles .
Liberals must articulate a vision of the Constitution , because what Americans understand the Constitution to say acts as a constraintThe shocking election of Donald Trumpimprisoned and force-fedbeaten and lynchedRight now , in the days and weeks and months after Trump 's upset victory , we must articulate a vision of the Constitution to combat the idea that our changed country is a deviation from it .
It is deeply unsettling to a large segment of Americans that they can suffer in economic malaise while a black man occupies the highest office , as the country becomes less white and Christian , and as women assume new roles .
We need to be clear that there is no going back to when things were `` great '' just for white men - the changes we 've seen are the inevitable result of moving closer to the equality the Constitution requires .
We 're here , we 're queer , we 're female , we 're black , we 're brown , we 're Jewish and we 're Muslim .
As dire as things feel today , Trump , his supporters and the Republicans who bred them will eventually have to get used to it .
We must explain to change-resistant white people that an altered country is the inevitable result of adhering to the founding document they claim to revere .
But the more concrete and immediate reason we have to start talking about the Constitution is that many of the things Trump wants to do are not only terrible policy , but flagrantly unconstitutional .
We just elected a man who has proposed torturing people , making religious discrimination official policy , banning abortion and `` loosening up '' the First Amendment , along with a Congress full of Republicans who have proven incapable of standing up to him .
We can not let shock and fear and defeatism paralyze us .
When Trump proposes something that is off-the-table constitutionally , We the People must tell him early and often and loudly that we 're not going to take it .
Donald Trump becomes president-elect of the United States .
Watch here .
Breitbart editor : We defended Roy Moore to protect Donald Trump
The editor-in-chief of the ultra-conservative , Steve Bannon-run news outlet Breitbart admitted during a radio broadcast FridayDuring Friday morning 's broadcast of the SiriusXM Patriot station 's `` Breitbart News Daily '' program , host and editor-in-chief Alex Marlow stated in no uncertain terms that Moore was a `` horrible , '' `` terrible '' candidate , though the media property 's allegiance to Trump left him with `` no option '' but to defend his positions and his alleged behavior .
Multiple women have alleged that both the president and Moore either harassed or assaulted them in their years before taking elected office .
`` There was no option to throw Judge [ Roy ] Moore under the bus , '' said Marlow .
`` If you set the standard that Roy Moore , who was accused of abusing five women ...
If you make that the standard , the left is going to use it to take out President Trump .
`` Marlow continued to cast doubt on the credibility of Moore 's accusers , but reinforced the notion that , at the end of the day , his publication 's support of the Alabama candidate was not about the contender himself .
`` There was never any reason to cave unless you have a ... unless you would like President Trump to get removed from office , '' he continued .
`` And if not even removed from office , at least have massive distractions from his agenda so that we never accomplish anything for the remainder of the president 's term .
`` Marlow added that `` much of the Republican Party '' would like to see the president 's leadership derailed on those terms .
`` Much of the Republican Party does not see that as a negative , '' he said .
He continued his critique of Moore .
`` When you 've got a race when you 've got a horrible candidate .
Let 's not — you guys are being too polite about Roy Moore — he was a terrible candidate , '' he said .
`` His message did not resonate , he had all the baggage , he had the scandal .
When he 'd run for statewide office he 'd only won in very tight races or relatively tight , considering he 's the Republican .
Roy Moore was not a good candidate at all .
`` Throughout the contentious 2017 Alabama special election to replace Jeff Sessions , whom Trump nominated for Attorney General shortly after he won the presidency , Breitbart was one of Moore 's more active , vociferous defenders .
Working hard to deny the many claims of sexual misconduct against him , forward the candidate 's bizarre , often unconstitutional positions and cast aspersions on his opponents — first GOP primary candidate Luther Strange and then Democratic contender and eventual victor Doug Jones — Breitbart became a sort of mouthpiece for the Moore campaign , even when the campaign could barely speak on its own behalf .
Indeed , Breitbart leader and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon directly campaigned for Moore , framing the candidate as a Trumpian , anti-establishment vanguard of a new ultra-conservative takeover of Congress ( even though the president backed Strange in the primaries ) .
It seems now that even Bannon 's underlings knew Moore was a poor choice for Bannon 's planned conservative insurrection , an effort that now appears dead in the water .
As if it needs to be said , the cynicism of a news outlet backing a candidate it knows to be a poor politician — and perhaps an even worse person — for the benefit of another potentially equally compromised figure is titanic .
But then again , there has never been anything idealistic or pure about Breitbart 's support of the president or , indeed , the president 's support of the hard-right racial , political and cultural agenda that publication and its followers espouse .
They are all `` useful idiots '' for each other .
With that as the power exchange active in both conservative politics and conservative media , it only stands to reason that a `` terrible , '' `` horrible '' candidate such as Moore would go so far and create so much noise standing on their shoulders .

Sen. John McCain diagnosed with brain cancer
Arizona Sen. John McCain has been diagnosed with brain cancer .
McCain was in the hospital to remove a blood clot from above his left eye when a tumor was located .
Doctors revealed that McCain has been diagnosed with glioblastoma , an aggressive cancer .
The statement says the 80-year-old senator and his family are reviewing further treatment , including a combination of chemotherapy and radiation .
The doctors say McCain is recovering from his surgery amazingly well and his underlying health is excellent , according to the statement .
McCain responded to the `` outpouring of support '' in seemingly good spirits Thursday , promising over Twitter I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support - unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress , I 'll be back soon , so stand-by ! July 20 , 2017The office of McCain sent a statement that read , `` On Friday , July 14 , Sen. John McCain underwent a procedure to remove a blood clot from above his left eye at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix .
Subsequent tissue pathology revealed that a primary brain tumor known as glioblastoma was associated with the blood clot .
Scanning done since the procedure ( a minimally invasive craniotomy with an eyebrow incision ) shows that the tissue of concern was completely resected by imaging criteria .
The senator and his family are reviewing further treatment options with his Mayo Clinic care team .
Treatment options include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation .
The Senator 's doctors say he is recovering from his surgery ‘ amazingly well ' and his underlying health is excellent .
`` The statement continued , `` Senator McCain appreciates the outpouring of support he has received over the last few days .
He is in good spirits as he continues to recover at home with his family in Arizona .
He is grateful to the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic for their outstanding care , and is confident that any future treatment will be effective .
Further consultations with Senator McCain 's Mayo Clinic care team will indicate when he will return to the United States Senate .
`` His daughter , Meghan McCain , tweeted out a message , `` The news of my father 's illness has affected every one of us in the McCain family .
My grandmother , mother , brothers , sister and I have all endured the shock of the news , and now we live with the anxiety about what comes next .
`` John McCain 's wife Cindy posted a message on Instagram reading : `` Thank all of you for the wonderful thoughts .
@ senjohnmccain is doing well .
We as a family will face the next hurdle together .
One thing I do know is he is the toughest person I know .
He is my hero and I love him with all my heart .

Trump and Moore : Birther buddies reunite to promote more lies
The current political alliance between President Trump and Roy Moore is n't new - their collusion goes back at least to 2011 .
It was then that the two teamed up to promote the `` Birther Lie '' that President Obama was not born in the USA .
They served as active and vocal leaders of this racist cause over the five-year period from 2011 to 2016 .
President Obama 's short form and long form birth certificates were released by the Dept .
of Health of the State of Hawaii , in June 2008 and April 2011 respectively .
The birth records show that Barack Hussein Obama II was born at 7:24 pm on August 4 , 1961 , in the Kapiolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu , to Stanley Ann Dunham Obama and Barack Hussein Obama .
In the face of this documentary evidence , many early `` Birthers '' gave up the cause .
But not Trump and Moore .
They relentlessly promoted the lie , claiming in public speeches and interviews that they were privy to inside information that these birth certificates were forgeries .
Moore , who began his involvement in the cause in 2008 , declared to World Net Daily in 2010 that there was `` substantial evidence that Obama was not born in our country. ``
Trump , who did n't publicly join the cause until 2011 , tweeted on August 6 , 2012 that `` an ‘ extremely credible source ' has called my office and told me that Barack Obama 's birth certificate is a fraud .
`` Moore 's `` substantial evidence '' and Trump 's `` extremely credible source '' never , of course , materialized .
Moore combined his birther claims with the Islamophobic lie that Obama was secretly a Muslim , while Trump cleverly used the lie in his Presidential campaigns of 2012 and 2016 to solidify the nationalist , racist , anti-Obama core of his base .
The political effectiveness of the Birther Lie can be seen in the results of the NBC poll of September 2016 .
In the responses by registered Republicans only 28 % agreed with the statement that `` Barack Obama was born in the United States. ``
Another 41 % disagreed , and 31 % stated that they did n't know one way or the other .
The Birther Lie appears to have sowed doubt about the President being born in the U. S. , and thus the legitimacy of his Presidency , among nearly three-quarters of registered Republicans .
Trump officially gave up the `` Birther Lie '' on Sept. 16 , 2016 , with Moore doing so 3 months later .
When Trump gave up the lie , however , he replaced it with another one - naming his opponent Hillary Clinton as the originator of the whole birther idea , again of course without any evidence .
And now , in late 2017 , Trump has apparently decided to revive the lie , letting people around him know that he still believes it .
The `` Birther Lie '' shows us that Trump and Moore are inveterate liars .
So why should we believe them when they completely deny the credible testimonies of the more than 21 women who accuse one or the other of these men of sexual molesting them ?
Once again , these `` birther buddies '' would like us to ignore credible evidence and believe more of their big fat lies .

Dad Buys Used Desk For $ 150 On Craigslist , Then He Finds A Hidden Bag Filled With Money Inside
A Connecticut woman bought a desk from Staples , but after a few years grew tired of it .
She decided to sell it to Noah Muroff and his wife for about $ 150 on Craigslist .
There was nothing peculiar about the transaction at all .
Muroff and his wife had difficulty fitting the desk into the room .
They decided to take it apart to fit it in .
After Noah removed the filing cabinets , he noticed a plastic bag poking out .
First , he saw a $ 100 bill .
Then he saw that inside there were stacks of them .
He and his wife counted the money .
There was a whopping $ 98,000 .
`` If we did n't take those drawers out , we never would have found it , '' Muroff said .
But he knew immediately that he could n't keep the money .
He called the woman he bought it from .
It turned out she hid her inheritance in the desk and could n't remember where she put it .
When Muroff called her , she was speechless .
`` She was so shocked and touched that anyone would call , '' he said .
`` She said , ‘ You could have kept the money and nobody would have ever known .
' '' Muroff , who is a rabbi , and his wife believe honesty is the most important thing .
`` We both agreed that this is not our money , '' he said .
`` If God wants us to have $ 98,000 , he 'll make sure to give it to us in some other way .
`` The woman was so grateful , she summed up how she felt in a thank-you card .
`` I do not think there are too many people in this world that would have done what you did by calling me .
I do like to believe that there are still good people left in this crazy world we live in .
You certainly are one of them , '' the woman wrote .
`` I can not thank you enough for your honesty and integrity .
`` Please SHARE this story if you 're glad Noah Muroff did the right thing for the woman ! Due to restrictions , this video can not be viewed in your region .
Donald Trump labels NFL player `` son of a bitch ''
Colin Kaepernick is one of the most divisive players to have ever played in the NFL , on the back of his stance against police brutality last year , and his refusal to stand during pre-game national anthems as a result .
Criticism rained down on the former San Francisco 49ers Quarterback for his actions , but he also won support aplenty from fellow athletes and onlookers for his social justice stance .
The 29-year-old is currently unemployed because of his actions , however , and NFL clubs are reluctant to touch him because of the publicity that his protests attract .
Speak out and you 're damned , so it goes .
Kaepernick is one of the most courageous sports stars in the world , and should be lauded for not accepting what others know is wrong , but keep their mouths shut anyway .
Instead , despite being one of the best quarterbacks in the game , he does n't have a club .
US president Donald Trump was speaking at a rally in Alabama on Friday night when he took declining NFL TV ratings to task , going on to claim that the lack of physicality in the game was a reason for this .
Then he turned his attention to the Milwaukee man 's tendency to kneel during national anthems , and without mentioning by name , referred to him as a `` son of a bitch. ``
`` Would n't you love to see one of these NFL Owners , when someone disrespects our flag to say , ‘ get that son of a bitch off the field right now , he 's fired , he 's fired , '' Trump said to the crowd .

Michael Douglas denies masturbating in front of ex-employee : ' I 'm bewildered '
Michael Douglas has jumped ahead of allegations he masturbated in front of a former employee , insisting he 's not about to sit back and become the villain of a harassment story .
The Basic Instinct star claims staff at both The Hollywood Reporter and Variety have reached out for feedback concerning accusations he pleasured himself in front of an employee three decades ago , and he 's keen to get ahead of the story , before he joins the likes of Harvey Weinstein , Louis C. K. , Jeremy Piven , and Brett Ratner , among others , who have been accused of sexual misconduct .
Douglas has turned to movie news website DeadlineRevealing that The Hollywood Reporter contacted him via his attorney regarding the woman 's claims that he used `` colourful language '' in front of her , `` spoke raunchily , or dirtily with friends of mine in private conversations on the phone '' .
The woman 's third claim was that the actor masturbated in front of her , to which Douglas responds , `` I remembered this woman : sophisticated intelligent , good sense of humour , a novelist , who has written books and published novels and was an active feminist , and proud of it .
My head was reeling .
I just could n't put this together .
`` Insisting she `` could have excused herself '' if she was offended by the language he used in private conversations , Douglas adds the allegations he blackballed the unnamed women are `` completely untrue '' .
He adds that the claims he masturbated in front of her are `` a complete lie , fabrication '' .
According to the actor , the journalist at The Hollywood Reporter agreed to sit on the story over the holidays , but in the New Year the publication got back in touch and said , `` ‘ She 's ( accuser ) running around , possibly trying to give this story to other people , so we 're going to run with it ' .
`` I said , ‘ I do n't think that 's justification , just because you might get scooped , to run a story like this'… I was floored , '' he continues .
`` I did n't know what to say and I tried to digest it .
The accusations are minimal , except of course for the idea of masturbating in front of her .
She supposedly had three friends who would back her up , that she had mentioned this to… '' How am I , in a 50 year career in this industry , dealing with an employee 33 years ago who perhaps is disgruntled that I let her go , even though I have never heard from her in 32 years .
And a legitimate trade publication is going to try and print this story ?
There is no corroboration , just that they found out somebody else might run the story .
`` Douglas calls the whole saga `` extremely painful '' , adding , `` I pride myself on my reputation in this business… I 'm bewildered why , after 32 years , this is coming out , now .
`` The part that hurt the worst is having to share something like this to your wife and your children .
My kids are really upset , have to go to school worrying this is going to be in some article about me , being a sexual harasser .
They 're scared and very uncomfortable .
`` Douglas also states this is n't `` the New Year I had anticipated '' , adding he 's worried the drama may affect upcoming work he has booked .
`` I 'm fearful , '' he says .
`` I have jobs going with studios who all seem to be supportive at this time .
I 'm hurt , really hurt and offended and I wonder if people realize when you do something like this , it hurts a lot more than just one person .

Turns Out The Uxbridge Fresh Prince Of Bad Hair Is 19 , Still In High School , And Put Uxbridge High On Lockdown After A Gun Incident On Snapchat
Turns Out The Uxbridge Fresh Prince Of Bad Hair Is 19 , Still In High School , And Put Uxbridge High On Lockdown After A Gun Incident On SnapchatWant to advertise with Turtleboy ?

com for more information .
Earlier today we blogged about the Uxbridge Fresh Prince of Bad HairWe could n't find his Facebook page , but within an hour we had a million people pointing us to his Uxbridge street name - Tre PattersonAs you can see , we 're dealing with a real winner here .
This year Tre , who recently moved here from `` down south , '' and claims to have enrolled at Uxbridge High School because the coach at UConn told him it would help him get recruited , was suspended multiple times .
One of the incidents happened when he got the school put on lock down because he had beef with kids from another school on snapchat , and he claimed he had a gun on snapchat , DURING SCHOOL HOURS , and the other kids were coming to UHS with more guns .
After being uncooperative with the principals AND the cops about it , he was escorted off the premises and suspended .
Not expelled- just suspended .
Because I 'm sure when he came back he had a newfound thirst for knowledge and a desire to follow school rules .
He also was on the basketball and football teams , but hardly ever played because his grades were n't good enough .
It 's hard passing college prep math when you 're only 19 years old .
So much for UConn .
Here he is all dolled up for the first of many junior proms to come for Tre-Tre : Of course he 's the cool kid because he can legally buy booze in Canada and no one else can : Do n't worry though , the fam is holding it down on Facebook and has gone full free my boi ! Apparently his response to the cops after he shot the autistic man was that he `` did n't know he had autism. ``
Because it 's OK to shoot people with BB guns in public as long as they 're not autistic .
Oh , and autistic people all have tattoos on their forehead that let them know they 're autistic .
That 's literally the though process of this nudnik .
Anyway , this is yet another example of the failed educational policies from our state and federal government .
This is what happens when administrators value their graduation rates more than the well-being of the entire school - they keep shitheads like this in school instead of expelling them .
Because it looks better on a chart if they have less dropouts .
Oh , and do n't forget that schools all have mandates from the federal government , due to Arne Duncan 's reign of terror , to reduce suspension rates , particularly for students of color .
So now schools like Uxbridge are forced to keep morons like this , who obviously have no intention of learning , enrolled in schools .
They make it impossible for teachers to do their job and they poison the rest of the student body with their bullshit .
Uxbridge High School lost an entire day of learning because of him .
If somehow he graduates this year he 'll be 20 when he does so .
And it will only be the result of social promotion , fueled by a desire for better charts .
We urge you to support the following local businesses .
Shannon Sharpe goes after NFL owners ' hypocrisy over `` unity ''
The NFL national anthem story is n't going away anytime soon .
During many debate shows that air on cable sports networks , it was topic one .
This was especially true during true during FS1 's Undisputed with Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe .
Sharpe first said he was `` disappointed and … unimpressed , '' about the whole thing .
And then he expressed why he was disappointed and unimpressed : `` I 'm disappointed , Skip and Joy , because this is the tipping point .
Of the 7,537 things that President Trump has said in the last 50 years , him calling an NFL player a ‘ SOB ' is what brought the NFL , the owners and players together .
And while some might be moved by the conscience of these NFL owners , it was n't their conscience that moved them .
It was the cash .
Because see Skip , what we know about people with money , they do n't like to be told what to do…they do n't like being bullied .
You see , President Trump has bullied a lot of people … '' Sharpe then mentioned Trump 's comments on Mexico , attacking a Gold Star family after last year 's Democratic National Convention , and his statements to former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush about women saying , `` that did not shock the conscience of NFL owners .
`` And he also pointed out a number of owners , including Jerry Jones , Daniel Snyder , Shad Khan , and Robert Kraft , who contributed to Trump 's inauguration .
`` Now I 'm unimpressed because this was n't a protest .
This was unity .
So what are we showing solidarity against , Skip ?
We 're showing solidarity because President Trump .
.
he challenged the very men … wealthy , wealthy men … billionaires and he told them what you should do if someone protests , you should fire them .
They do n't like being told what to do , Skip .
`` And then , Skip , he called players that protested the anthem … he called them ‘ SOB 's . '
Think about that now , he called them ‘ SOB 's . '
That 's what got the owners , that 's what got the players to unite .
`` Is that the worst that he 's ever said ?
Absolutely not .
Never called Vladimir Putin an ‘ SOB , ' Never called ( Erdogan ) of Turkey an ‘ SOB , ' even those men that walked down the streets in Charlottesville , Virginia … he never said ‘ SOB ' … '' This was an impassioned Sharpe .
He also pointed out Colin Kaepernick , who started the kneeling during the national anthem , was forgotten and the NFL owners were uniting against Donald Trump .
`` It was n't until he came for the NFL that their conscience was shocked !
`` Sharpe said of all the teams that issued statements this weekend , only the Seattle Seahawks got the reason why they were denouncing the President 's statements .
And he also set his sights on fellow FS1 analyst Ray Lewis for previously criticizing Kaepernick and then kneeling on the sideline with the Baltimore RavensIt was one of the more emotional segments on Undisputed in its brief history .
Islam and the Mistreatment of Women
Allah 's decrees enshrine inequality .
Although Allah allows a husband to beat his wife , there is no provision in the Qur'an for a wife to beat her husband .
Nor can she initiate a divorce .
Only men can do so , and with relative ease .
In `` Heretic , '' Ayaan Hirsi Ali explains the shackles of sharia for women , including `` the right of men to have unfettered sexual access to their wives , the right of men to practice polygamy , and the restriction of women 's legal rights in divorce cases , in estate law , in cases of rape , in court testimony , and in consent to marriage .
`` According to Sharia , women ( and little girls ) who are captives of war can be raped by their Muslim captors .
But girls who have sex outside of marriage are flogged , and women who commit adultery are stoned .
Two incidents almost 14 centuries apart show just how deeply the exploitation of women is ingrained In Sharia .
In August 2014 , after Muslim fighters captured Yazidi villages in the Sinjar region of northern Iraq , they executed the men and adolescent boys by spraying them with automatic-weapons fire .
What happened to women and children might truly have been worse .
As chronicled in the Islamic State on-line magazine `` Dabiq , '' `` After capture , the Yazidi women and children were then divided according to the Sharī'ah amongst the fighters of the Islamic State who participated in the Sinjar operations , after one fifth of the slaves were transferred to the Islamic State 's authority to be divided .
`` Sadly , the victim was just one of countless thousands in the history of Islam .
In 627 , Muhammad and his fighters invaded the villages of the prosperous Banu Mustaliq Jewish tribe on the shores of the Red Sea .
As with the Yazidis , the Jewish men and boys murdered by Muhammad and his Muslim hordes were spared the unthinkable atrocities their loved ones were about to suffer .
In accordance with the law of Allah , many were raped , others sold as chattel .
Muhammad , revered by Muslims the world over as the founder of their religion , took a Jewish woman as booty after having her husband and hundreds more men beheaded .
Then he forced her on his bed and added her to his stable of wives and concubines .
Though the Yazidi and Mustaliq atrocities bookend nearly 1,400 years of Islamic history , their treatment of female captives was virtually identical .
Why ?
Because , as chronicled in `` Dabiq , '' what the Islamic State does in the 21st century is an authentic application of the teachings and practices of Muhammad .
Ayaan Hirsi Ali tells the horrifying story of a 13-year-old girl in Somalia who was found guilty of adultery after reporting that she had been raped by three men .
Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow - named after Muhammad 's 9-year-old wife - was dragged , screaming and flailing , into a sports stadium in Kismayo to be stoned .
`` It took four men to bury her up to her neck in the hole , '' Hirsi Ali wrote .
`` Then fifty men spent ten minutes pelting her with rocks and stones .
Then she was dug out of the ground and two nurses examined her to see if she was still alive .
Someone found a pulse and breathing .
Aisha was returned to the hole and the stoning continued .
`` After she died , `` a local sheik told a radio station that Aisha had provided evidence , confirmed her guilt , and 'was happy with the punishment under Islamic law .

6 Promising New Medical Treatments for Cancer
Medical science is constantly making cancer breakthroughs , however there 's an extensive process to bring treatments to the public .
After making a discovery in the lab and performing tests , there are human clinical trials that require oversight by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) before approval .
That being said , there are some promising new treatments ( with some currently still in the investigational stages ) targeting cancer , and they could prove valuable to millions of patients in the U. S. and beyond in the future .
Here are six experimental cancer treatments that are catching attention from the medical world…BestMedicalDegrees .
com outlines this experimental use of heat to target tumors .
This technique can zero in on specific areas or heat the whole body , which will break down protein cells within a tumor and cause them to die , notes the source .
While the treatment can potentially blast away existing cells , it could also help prevent new ones from forming .
`` Hyperthermia Therapy is very exciting because , if it turns out to be a viable treatment , this will destroy the cancerous tumors from the inside out and hinder its ability to infect more healthy cells , '' adds the source .
Also called adoptive cell transfer , the experimental technique aims to improve the ability of a patient 's natural T-cells ( lymphocytes for immunity ) to fight cancer , according to the National Cancer Institute .
Doctors can take the best and most active T-cells that have invaded a tumor and extract them to multiply in a lab - the patient 's immune cells are then wiped out and the lab-grown cells are re-infused back to them , it adds .
There are variations of this treatment , and the first use of it targeted metastatic melanoma , which can spread quickly through the body .
Modified T-cells are also being looked at to treat other solid tumors as well as hematologic cancers ( cancers of the blood ) , it adds .
ABC News says in an article that this therapy consists of drugs that are aimed at destroying only specific cancer cells , without negatively affecting healthy cells as many existing treatments do .
`` Thus , people taking the drugs too often suffer horrible side effects on top of whatever havoc the cancer itself is already wreaking , '' notes the source .
ABC says the leading drug in this new therapy is called Glivec ( or STI571 ) .
It is designed to treat a specific form a leukemia called chronic myeloid leukemia , which has about 7,000 new cases per year in the U. S. , adds the source .
`` Doctors are extremely hopeful that the drug could provide a model for similar drugs to treat cancers affecting many thousands more people , '' it notes .
The National Cancer Institute detailed a potential new cancer therapy in early 2017 , which looks to target ovarian cancer cells .
The basics are that tumor cells `` express '' a protein called TNFR2 , which can prevent a patient 's natural immune system from attacking a tumor .
Researchers have developed new antibodies that target TNFR2 , as well as having the ability to kill ovarian cancer cells , thus `` killing two birds with one stone , '' notes the source .
The team found that ovarian cancer cells express an abnormal level of TNFR2 that can promote tumor growth - and the source points out other types of cancers , such as colon and kidney cancer , also show unusual TNFR2 production .
`` These electrical fields exert selective toxicity in proliferating cells thereby halting cell division and destroying the cancer cells , '' notes the source .
While the treatment is used in conjunction with oral chemotherapy drugs for glioblastoma ( GBM ) , it can be used on its own to target recurrent ( returning ) GBM when other options have been exhausted , according to the source .
Usually , having a virus is a bad thing .
However , this therapy essentially involves introducing a virus to cancer cells that leave healthy cells alone , notes StandUp2Cancer .
org .
The virus only seeks out cancer cells due to their genetic mutation that normal cells do n't have , it explains .
One treatment in particular is called Reolysin , developed by a Canadian biotechnology company , notes the source .
The site notes that almost 300-patients `` with various forms of cancer '' in Canada , the U. S. and the U. K. have been treated with this therapy , which infects cancer cells and causes them to explode .
Apparently , side effects ( such as a low-grade fever ) are a lot milder than those associated with chemotherapy and radiation , it adds .
Why Criminals Stealing Suppressors Is n't The Problem Some Anti-Gunners Think
Despite being around for more than a century , suppressors are n't really used in crimes .
In fact , it seems like the only time you see a crime committed with a suppressor , it 's where having the suppressor itself is illegal for whatever reason .
They 're just not used that way very often .
However , if the Hearing Protection Act passes as part of the SHARE Act , suppressors will likely become far more common .
That has the hysterical tribe at The Trace worried about criminals getting their grubby little paws on them via theft Congress could vote as soon as this weekThe more pertinent public safety question , however , is what could happen if many more silencers enter circulation .
Even with the hurdles that silencer buyers must deal with , demand for the items is already increasing , fueled by a new generation of suppressors and some slick marketing .
There are now more that 1 .
3 million of them registered with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , up from about 360,000 just five years ago .
There 's also evidence to suggest that as silencers have gained a foothold with gun owners , some are winding up in the black market .
We 've written beforeextended magazinesTo be sure , theft is a legitimate concern .
It 's impossible to keep things out of criminals ' hands because they 're often acquired via theft , either directly or indirectly on the black market .
I 'd like to applaud The Trace for at least acknowledging that criminals are unlikely to walk into a gun store and buy suppressors .
Good for them .
Make no mistake , criminals will get their hands on suppressors via theft .
It 's going to happen , unfortunately .
Of course , criminals can make suppressors in their garage right now .
All the information is on the internet for anyone and their brother to look at if they so choose .
It 's been that way for years .
Yet they 're still rarely used in crime .
Why is that ? Take a look at this photo of a suppressed pistol , since handguns are the preferred weapon of the average criminal .
Note that the suppressor extends well beyond the weapon .
In fact , it doubles the overall length of the weapon .
Guess what this does ?
It makes it very , very difficult to hide a suppressed firearm .
Seriously , try tucking one of those in the front of your pants sometime and see how quickly you draw .
This makes suppressors very difficult to sneak into a convenience store .
It 's also difficult to mill about waiting for someone to pull the gun on and rob .
While criminals will , no doubt , get their hands on suppressors in the course of their `` career , '' it wo n't really help them much .
They 're terrible options for their line of work , and with the internet 's instructions laying the mysteries of the suppressor bare years ago , there 's no reason to fear them getting into any crooks hands .
They 're likely already there , and they figure out quickly they 're useless for their purposes .
Twitter Was Not Here For Sean Spicer 's Emmy Appearance
All in all , the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards was a pretty good Emmys .
Stephen Colbert did n't make a single racially insensitive joke , Lena Waithe gave an incredibly inspiring acceptance speech , the gay episode of Black Mirror won twice , and there was not a Modern Family win in sight .
But there was one dark cloud over the evening : the surprise , supposedly comedic appearance by disgraced former press secretary Sean Spicer .
Judging by the Sean Spicer Emmy reactionsMaybe it 's a good thing the 2017 Emmys got this questionable political stunt out of the way early .
The Former White House Press Secretary to President Trump was brought out on stage by host Stephen Colbert at the end of his opening monologue .
The real Spicer rolled out on a mobile podium , famously used by Melissa McCarthy in her impressions of him on Saturday Night Live .
The real Spicer got a few jokes in .
He referenced his famously inaccurate judgment of the inauguration crowd size by saying , This is the largest audience to witness the Emmys , period .
Both in person and around the world .
Ha ha .
Wink wink .
Nudge nudge .
Get it ?
It 's totally fine that he spewed blatant lies to the American public , because now we can all laugh about it together ! The audience laughed and cheered for this former face of the Donald Trump presidency , and then later in the night gave all the Emmys to The Handmaid 's Tale , you know , that show about how a dystopian , oppressive government is a bad thing .
Yay , cognitive dissonance ! Anyways , I 'm not the only one who found this particular political stunt to be in fairly bad taste .
The reaction on Twitter to Sean Spicer 's Emmy appearance was overwhelmingly negative — from both regular viewers and celebrity viewers .
Former SNL player and actress Jenny Slate tweeted that she was `` so grossed out '' by the decision .
She said , Truly so grossed out by A GROUP of people ever even considering the idea of real life Spicer at the Emmys .
What is wrong with you ?
Wake up .
Similarly , actor Zach Braff tweeted , I 'm not ready to laugh `` with '' Sean Spicer .
I think he is an evil , opportunistic liar that hurt our country .
Filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner , known for his role as Max Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street , tweeted , DT is a sick liar .
If we reward Sean Spicer for enabling his sickness , we are saying we accept a mentally ill POTUS .
And of course , though she did n't share her opinion on Twitter , Melissa McCarthy 's reactionMany non-celebrities also shared their disapproval on Twitter , some viewer lamenting the double standard for 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and this small angry liar .
Others critiqued the Television Academy for its hypocrisy .
Again , though the night was filled anti-Trump sentiment , inspiring speeches about political activism , and supposedly subversive post-Trump television , Spicer was still invited onto that very same stage where that all took place .
And according to journalist Chris Gardner of The Hollywood Reporter , who attended the show , Spicer had no lack of fans and attention after the Emmys .
Gardner tweeted , What pariah ?
Sean Spicer getting mobbed in # Emmys lobby .
Posing for pics , drinking beer , soaking up all attention after onstage appearance .
Do n't you just love it when lying politicians — who are so terrible at their job even Donald Trump has to fire them — become beloved , whacky celebrities ?
Thanks for that one , Academy of Television Arts & Sciences .
A Grain Of Saul : Stopping Sexual Assault Is Not A Partisan Issue Or A Women 's Issue . It 's Up To All Of Us .
A Grain of Saul is a weekly column that digs into some of the biggest issues we face as a nation and as an international community in search of reliable data , realistic solutions , and — most importantly — hope .
More and more women are reporting that Harvey WeinsteinAfter an explosive piece in The New York Timesa piece in The New Yorker quoted nearly a dozen on the record firsthand accounts of Weinstein 's harassment and sexual assaultAlthough Weinstein apologized in a statement for at least some of the behaviorThat piece , a gut-punch for anyone holding out hope the worst was n't true , was notably written by journalist Ronan Farrow .
Farrow is the estranged son of Woody Allenwere made by his own daughter , Ronan 's sister DylanWith so many accusers against Weinstein now on the record , including household names like Gwyneth Paltrow , Cara Delevingne and Angelina Jolie , all corners of the country are offering their hot takes in the discussion .
Perhaps one of the most unfortunate reactions has been to politicize the story , as some conservative pundits have grasped onto Weinstein — a major Democratic donor Michelle Obama once publicly praised as a `` wonderful human being '' — as illustrative of rotten liberal America .
But this is n't a uniquely Democratic problem .
Fox News , a notoriously right-wing news outlet , has had to dismiss a slew of on-air talent because of sexual assault allegationsalso been photographed chumming it up with WeinsteinThe point being : this is n't a partisan or even a political issue .
This is — largely — an issue with men , specifically men who yield any kind of power .
The allegations leveled against Weinstein , Allen , Bill Cosby , Bill O'Reilly , Roger Ailes , Anthony Weiner and President Trump are not unique to Hollywood or a certain political party .
It 's not always famous and powerful men , either : it 's the Catholic Church , Penn State football , orthodox Jews , professional athletes , universities , and your local retail store .
The list goes on .
In many of the cases that have made national headlines , though , wealthy men in positions of significant power have leveraged their status to pressure or force women into sexual encounters .
Those women are then shamed , threatened with lawsuits and silenced if they speak out .
Perhaps most unsettling about these stories is that there is almost always someone who could have stepped up and stopped the harassment or assault .
In Farrow 's story , he wrote that 16 former and current employees of Weinstein 's companies had witnessed or had knowledge of unwanted sexual advances Weinstein made in work-related settings .
Sixteen !
And that 's just the number of current or former employees who happened to speak to Farrow .
What about all the ones who did n't ?
What about the ones who were too scared to speak to a reporter ? Weinstein 's case , again , is n't unique .
In President Trump 's infamous Hollywood Access tape , television host Billy Bush laughs offrepeatedly reported to human resources at Fox NewsPeople — especially men who are in positions of power — have the ability to step in and stop these stories from happening .
And we can not forget that there are male survivors of sexual assault , and they are every bit as worth protecting .
Terry Crews came out on Twitter to share a story about being assaulted by another man who allegedly grabbed his penis while Crews was standing next to his wife at a Hollywood function .
Crews said he decided not to retaliate with allegations against the man because he did n't want to be ostracized , noting that `` the predator has power and influence. ``
Instead , he let it go , like many women do , because he could n't stop asking himself if anyone believe him and if the repercussions for speaking out would be life-changing .
If Terry Crews , a wealthy , well-known man is wary of reporting his assault , imagine the obstacles that face many other sexual assault survivors .
It 's time for men to police our own communities , our own friends and our own family members .
It 's time for men to stop being passive observers of the kinds of harassment and overt sexism that are all too common in the spaces we dominate .
It 's time for men to stand up for the victims we see in our day-to-day lives , and to create spaces , environments , communities , teams , companies and homes where everyone feels safe and supported enough to speak truth to power .
The issue of sexual assault can not simply be a `` women 's issue. ``
It can not be a political talking point .
It can not be a Democrat or Republican or religious or campus issue .
Sexual assault is a men 's issue .
It is my issue .
It is your issue .
And it 's about time we did something about it .
Why FBI 's James Comey 'Reopened ' Clinton Email Probe Days Before the Election
Here 's one thing we can all say for certain regarding the latest twist of the Hillary Clinton email scandal : James Comey , who was once regarded as the Eliot Ness of law enforcement , a modern day straight-shooter impenetrable to political pressure , will instead leave the office of FBI chief as something closer to Inspector Clouseau .
Do n't take my word for it ; that 's the assessment of just about every law enforcement official , both former and present , I spoke to in the hours following his bizarre decision on Friday to reopen the case on the legality of Hillary Clinton 's email server , just days before the Nov 8 presidential election .
It was bizarre , these people tell me , because the whole sordid Hillary Clinton email saga should never have gotten this far ; Comey launched an investigation that developed far more evidence than anyone in law enforcement ever believed existed that Hillary Clinton broke the laws involving the receipt of sensitive government documents over an easily hacked private email server while she was President Obama 's secretary of state .
My sources in law enforcement were pretty convinced Comey would do the right thing and recommend charges to the Obama Justice Department , despite its political consequence , because the evidence was there and Comey was supposed to be so non political .
He was a Republican appointed by Democrat Barack Obama to run a quasi independent investigative arm of the DOJ because he had a fierce independent streak .
He famously brought white-collar cases during the pro-business Bush Administration as the US Attorney for the Southern District .
Later in a senior position in the Bush DOJ , he refused to approve aspects of the government 's domestic surveillance program .
But there appears to be limits to Comey 's independence , these same people now concede .
In July , Comey came up with an odd excuse for not recommending criminal charges against Clinton : He could n't develop enough evidence that Clinton intended to break the law under the standard of `` gross negligence .
`` It was such an odd set rationale that Comey laid out for not bringing that case that most people listening to him at first thought he was laying out his reasoning to bring charges , as he explained one reckless move after another from Clinton in establishing the private server and private emails for handing all her government business .
Indeed he initially laid out such a convincingly damning case against Clinton that markets began to crash for much of Comey 's tortured remarks as investors initially came to the conclusion that Hillary Clinton would be indicted and someone as crazy as Donald Trump could become president .
That did n't happen , of course , as Comey would explain -- and the markets that day recovered as he announced how Hillary Clinton may have done something criminal even if she never intended to do it and as a result he was giving her pass .
Note to reader : Markets will take criminal over crazy any day of the week .
But that was n't the sentiment inside the FBI , where according to my law enforcement sources , a near mutiny broke out among career agents who believe there was plenty of evidence pointing to Clinton 's gross negligence that Comey initially said never existed , and that their boss caved to political pressure from the Obama DOJ .
Recall , Attorney General Loretta Lynch just had a private meeting with former president and possible first husband Bill Clinton just days before Comey handed in his verdict , which added to the fetid smell of the FBI chief 's decision .
Then there was the evidence : Remember , Clinton has never given much of a rationale for using only a private email account via her own server to send and receive state department related emails other than its convenience , which should never outweigh national security .
Meanwhile , career agents argued her intent was inherent in simple creation of the private email server and exclusive use of a private email is supposed to be verboten under various laws including the Espionage Act .
Her supporters point out that others like Bush Administration Secretary of State Colin Powell used a private email account , but that omits the fact that Powell 's email was from a computer he kept at the state department and he used it before the document laws were beefed up post 9-11 .
He also did n't go through the process of creating his own easily hacked private server .
Another difference : Clinton used her private account exclusively , and Powell did n't .
That 's probably because Powell did n't have a reason to have a private server that he could control and erase its contents ; He did n't have a private charity that would do business with the federal government and would become a private enrichment vehicle , as Hillary and her former-president husband Bill have in the form of the Clinton Foundation .
Now we have Comey possibly looking to make amends with his troops , possibly looking to cover his rear end , definitely looking incompetent , because of all people Anthony Weiner , the disgraced former Congressman , and soon-to-be ex husband of Hillary Clinton confident , Huma Abedin .
FBI agents , investigating Weiner 's alleged depravity with an underage girl , stumbled across some more Hillary-related emails from Abedin , and as we learned Friday an investigation that was `` closed '' is now suddenly open .
I say closed in quotes to underscore the murkiness of FBI investigative procedures .
Cases are rarely officially closed and even when they are the bureau will leave the door open that additional information would re-ignite their efforts .
If you think this story could get any more surreal consider the following : law enforcement sources tell Fox Business that Weiner could soon cooperate with the Feds , and that ca n't be good news for his wife or her boss .
( an attorney for Anthony Weiner tells Fox News there is no cooperation agreement in place ) Weiner , I am told , was miffed at the Clinton 's for keeping him away from the campaign before his latest sexting episode .
Now facing a possible prison term for alleged dealings with an underage girl he has even more incentive to cooperate against his soon-to-be ex-wife and the Clintons .
I ca n't tell you whether the new emails will reach Comey 's standard for gross negligence , but that 's really besides the point .
The country could have been spared this spectacle if he had just done the right thing in July and recommended a charge against Clinton .
Then the Democrats could have regrouped and given the nomination to Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden or someone who does n't stand a chance of being indicted or impeached if elected .
Yes if Hillary Clinton manages to win , she will be a sitting duck for every GOP investigative committee , particularly as the odds grow the Republicans will now keep the House and possibly the Senate .
If you thought the last eight years were contentious , you ai n't seen nothing yet .
Thank you , James Comey .
Georgina Chapman Leaves Harvey Weinstein in Wake of Scandal
There are some cases where , for reasons that the public can seldom understand , the wife of a man accused of something as simple as cheating or as monstrous as sexual assault will stand by her man .
That 's the whole premise of The Good Wife , sort of .
That 's not true of every wife , however .
After all of the accusations against Harvey Weinstein that have come out into the open and been made public , Georgina Chapman is parting ways with the former big-name studio executive after ten years of marriage .
Considering that Harvey Weinstein has been fired from his own companyAfter these kinds of allegations , it would be hard to understand anyone who would n't put some distance between themselves and the accused .
First came the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment accusationsAfter decades of rumors , the biggest surprise was n't the nature of the accusations so much as that the article was actually published .
A lot of the times , powerful people pull strings and call in favors to make problems go away .
Some of the allegations were creepy but not damning -- stories about him promising young actresses that he 'd boost their careers if they did certain things for him .
That 's gross , but there are situations ( clearly not involving Weinstein ) where both parties might consent to that sort of arrangement in a way that would benefit everyone .
The other accusations that came out in that same expose -- about coercing women to drink and watch him shower , about pulling out his penis without invitation and masturbating before an unwilling audience -- were beyond just creepy .
Some of those things are crimes and none of them are okay .
Things looked bleak for Harvey Weinstein , and he was condemned by major namesHell , some people who are accused of sexual assault and also famously recorded bragging about it go on to become President .
Men with money can get away with a lot .
Then , yesterday , the New Yorker released more -- allegations of Harvey Weinstein committing sexual assaultA number of actresses came forward as accusers , and his is now accused of outright rape .
Suddenly , his powerful former friends are returning his donations but not his calls .
Weinstein 's career is almost certainly history at this point .
And so , it seems , is his marriage .
Now 41 , she married Harvey Weinstein in 2007 .
The couple has two children together : India Pearl , who is 7 years old , and Dashiell Max Robert , who is 4 .
In a statement to People , Georgina Chapman reveals that she and Harvey Weinstein are separating '' My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions .
I have chosen to leave my husband .
Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time .
`` We 've seen a number of extremely bad takes on Harvey WeinsteinFirst , she expresses sympathy for his victims .
Second , she makes it clear that sexual assault is unforgivable -- which it is .
Third , she announces that she 's leaving Harvey Weinstein .
And fourth , she emphasizes that she 's putting her children first , which is what every parent should always , always do .
Rose McGowan is naming names ( Honestly , bless Rose McGowan for having zero chill about anything , ever ) Harvey Weinstein already seems like he 's toast , but it could cost others -- possibly even Ben Affleck -- his career .
Something tells us that there are more accusations against Harvey Weinstein out there that just have n't come to light yet .

A guide to the confusing world of sponsored Facebook posts , which make it hard to distinguish between ads and journalism
It used to be pretty easy to tell the difference between advertising and editorial content on Facebook .
If a post had a little `` sponsored '' label on it , that was a red flag telling you , `` Hey , a brand paid for this , you should treat it as an advertisement. ``
But that line has gotten blurrier for Facebook users , especially over the last few months as Facebook has limited how far posts from media companies can spread on their own ( so-called `` organic reach '' ) .
In January , Facebook announced that it would de-emphasize publisher content in favor of `` friends and familyAnd that is what many publishers - from The New Yorker , to The Wall Street Journal , to Marie Claire ( and Business Insider ) - have been doing for certain articles , with more frequency since the algorithm change .
They have paid Facebook to help their editorial , journalistic articles spread .
The Facebook posts that link to these articles are labeled `` sponsored , '' because they are technically ads , but they link to normal news articles .
When you follow the link to the publisher 's website , the article is n't a piece of `` sponsored content , '' even though the Facebook post is labeled `` sponsored .
`` Confusing , right ? But that 's only the start of the rabbit hole when it comes to the blurring of the lines between advertising and editorial content on Facebook .
Traditionally , media companies have worked to separate advertisements from journalistic writing ( and to properly label `` advertorial '' content ) .
But in the world of Facebook , these outlets do n't always even have control over how posts appear to readers .
Positive articles about companies like Uber ( for instance ) are being turned into promotional ads , sometimes without the media organizations being made aware .
It can be hard for readers to wade through , so we decided to break it down for you in a way that is easy to digest .
We 'll walk you through the various types of `` sponsored '' posts on Facebook and what they mean .
Let 's start with the one I just mentioned : Purely editorial articles that are being promoted with `` sponsored '' posts on Facebook .
This basically happens when a publisher wants to boost an article it thinks has viral potential , and can bring the publisher in much more advertising ( or subscriber ) revenue than it is paying Facebook to push it into your feed , or get new readers .
Here is what that looks like from The New Yorker on an editorial article titled `` The Great Sadness of Ben AffleckAnd here 's one from The Wall Street Journal on an editorial article titled `` Silicon Valley to Washington : Why Do n't You Get UsJust scrolling through my Facebook feed casually , I noticed many such articles from outlets ranging from those above to Marie Claire ( as mentioned ) , Ranker , Screen Rant , Elite Daily , U. S. News and World Report , and so on .
They really run the gamut editorially .
Okay , so this type of post is easy enough to understand .
Here is where it starts to get more confusing .
Sometimes , the subject of an article pays Facebook to promote an editorial article written about them - presumably one that paints them in a positive light .
These are also technically `` ads '' on Facebook , but the journalism they are promoting was not paid for by the subject .
The article itself is not `` sponsored content , '' even though the Facebook post is `` sponsored .
`` Here 's an example with Uber and CNET : CNET wrote this article about Uber 's new CEO , titled `` Uber 's U-turn : How the new CEO is cleaning house after scandals and lawsuitsHere is an example from the video world .
This editorial video ( not an ad ) by NowThis MoneyAdam Khafif 's Facebook page is sharing a NowThis Money post from its Facebook page , and that share is being `` sponsored '' ( i. e. boosted by paying money to Facebook ) .
See , it gets very convoluted .
But the main point is that the underlying video , and in this case even the underlying original Facebook post , is n't an ad - but the subject of the video is paying for a `` sponsored '' Facebook post to promote it .
Sometimes these `` sponsored '' posts are even geo-targeted , like the one on this article from The New Yoker titled `` Divinity on the Dance FloorSchimanskiNow let 's get to influencers and celebrities .
Sometimes publishers pay influencers ( people with big Facebook followings ) to promote their articles .
This used to be done a lot through organic Facebook reach ( here 's an article on this about George TakeiHere 's an example from Snoop Dogg and FashionBeans : Snoop Dogg in this instance is technically paying Facebook to promote an article from FashionBeans , titled `` Here Are The Most Obnoxiously Rich Suburbs Of America 's Biggest CitiesNow we get to the last category : actual `` sponsored content '' from a media company .
This is an instance of `` advertorial , '' where the advertiser is directly paying the media company to sponsor the actual article itself .
Here 's an example from BuzzFeed and NBC Sports : In these cases , the word `` with '' is usually employed in the Facebook post to denote which company is paying for the underlying content .
It 's marked again if you follow the link to BuzzFeed 's site : Notice that the `` Brand Publisher '' is NBC Sports .
So this is actually an ad - not only on Facebook but on BuzzFeed 's site as well .
And there you have it , we 've come to the end of our guide to understanding who is paying to get journalism or advertising in front of you on Facebook .
One last thing to remember is that no matter who is paying for a `` sponsored '' Facebook post - outlet , subject , or influencer - if you check the actual article after following the link , it should clearly mark whether the article is an advertisement or a journalistic piece .
Republicans ' hilariously pathetic attempt to manufacture another Hillary Clinton scandal
They 've got her now , just you wait .
Republicans in Congress have Hillary Clinton in their sights , and it 's all going to be different this time .
They 're demandingYou may have noticed that Hillary Clinton is not actually the president , a fact that has left Republicans who were looking forward to four or eight years of rip-roaring investigations rather bereft .
So why not have the Justice Department investigate the president 's former opponent ?
Maybe they 'll get to lock her up after all .
Sure , that 's something that tends to happen in countries where elections are a prelude to tyranny , but is n't the American system far too lenient on people who commit the crime of losing an election ? What is the point of all this ?
The answer is a bit complicated , but first let 's quickly address the Republicans ' complaint .
In their fantasy world , what demands investigation is chiefly this : Hillary Clinton gave 20 percent of our uranium to Russia in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation , and there was obviously something fishy going on .
However , every bit of the previous sentence is false , other than that there is a person named `` Hillary Clinton , '' a thing called `` uranium , '' a place called `` Russia , '' and an organization called the `` Clinton Foundation .
`` In fact , the Russian government controls a company that has rights to mine a portion of the uranium located within the United States ( far less than 20 percent ) , and the uranium is n't allowed to leave the country .
The sale of that company was approved in 2013 by a board that includes representatives of nine different federal agencies ; though the State Department is one of the nine , Clinton had no personal role in the decision .
The donations to the Clinton Foundation that supposedly were payback actually occurred in 2007 , before she became secretary of state , from a man who no longer had any stake in the company by the time the sale took place ( you can read more herehereAs for the Russian dossier , it was opposition research of the kind undertaken by candidates for every significant office in America .
It contained some salacious rumors about Donald Trump , but the Clinton campaign did n't even make them public .
In short , this is n't the kind of thing you appoint a special counsel to investigate .
When this was brought up by far-right Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-Ohio ) , whom retired Speaker of the House John Boehner recently referredseemed uninterestedrecently saidIf there 's one thing Republicans know , it 's how to work a Clinton scandal .
You start with wild charges , whether there are any facts behind them or not , then start to hold hearings , create a rising din in the conservative media , and before you know it , you 've woven a scandal out of nothing .
Of course , you have to pretend that you care very deeply about consular security or proper email management or whatever the ostensible topic of the scandal is , but they can manage that without too much trouble .
This formula has to be understood as serving multiple goals .
In the short run , it merely makes trouble for Democrats , putting them on the defensive and dominating the news .
Now that Trump is president , it could also help distract attention from the administration 's scandals .
Since this story involves Russia too , it can potentially create a fog in the addled mind of the American public , to the point where `` Russia '' is just associated with a bunch of Washington corruption that involves both parties .
In the longer run , the investigation can act as a lever , producing something more consequential than whatever it set out to investigate .
Republicans do n't have to know what they 're fishing for at the outset ; it 's enough to hope that there might be something waiting to be uncovered .
The Benghazi investigation revealed the existence of Clinton 's private email server , so who knows what an investigation into the uranium company might produce ? And then there 's the emotional component .
Investigating Hillary Clinton promises a return to a simpler time , when Republicans felt a sense of righteousness and purpose , and did n't have to worry about crafting complicated legislation that required difficult tradeoffs .
That stuff is just no fun .
The trouble with the project , however , to return to where we started , is that Hillary Clinton is not the president and is never going to be the president .
She 's gone .
There is n't anything to be gained by rooting around like pigs hoping to unearth a truffle of scandal buried somewhere in the woods of Chappaqua .
All it does is make them look like sore winners .
Which of course is exactly what they are .
Nothing in the last year has turned out the way they thought it would , and they have no idea what to do about it .
A good Clinton scandal would make everything make sense again .
But they probably wo n't get it , so they 'll just have to content themselves with defending the toddler in the Oval Office and worrying about which of their candidates are going to turn out to have a thing for teenage girls .
Oh — and maybe passing some legislation .
If they get around to it .
Donald Trump Can not Be President of the United States
You can not vote for Donald Trump and pretend that this is just another election , and he is just another candidate .
Evan Vucci/APIt 's easy to make fun of the hats .
It 's not so easy to contemplate what makes so many people think America 's greatness is in desperate need of reformation , or what would make them turn to someone like Donald TrumpAmerica has flaws as deep as its founding , when the men who laid down basic principles of human rights - principles that have endured 240 years - were fed and clothed by human beings they owned .
That paradox still defines the fault lines of our nation , and it 's along those lines we are drawing the ugliest election in modern history .
It is n't just economic anxiety or trade deals or the opioid epidemic driving the mostly white , mostly male movement behind Trump 's campaign .
It is the existential fear of displacement from a world that has slowly - too slowly , for too long - been chipping away at white male supremacy .
The `` grab 'em by the pussy '' moment was disastrous for Trump 's campaign ; it reinforced the defining narrative of his sexism .
But it drew his strongest supporters even closer to him , because it reminded them of the world they 're losing .
They want to live in an America where they can grab women by the pussy and brag about it to their friends .
They want to casually use the n-word - just for the bad ones ; they 're not racist !
- without being set upon by the PC police .
They want what 's coming to them , what 's owed them .
And they are willing to burn down the world to get it .
Donald Trump is the worst major-party candidate for president in American history .
This is not a close call .
By virtually any measure , he is unfit to lead a Cub Scout troop , let alone the nation with the world 's most powerful military .
It 's worth going back and reading the transcriptsof his debateswith Hillary ClintonTrump 's values are , in a word , deplorable .
He launched his campaign calling Mexican immigrants rapists , issued a call for a ban on immigration by Muslims , and said women should be punished for getting an abortion .
He lies , constantly , about everything .
He stokes anger and fear and even violence among his supporters .
He nurtures their very worst instincts .
He brags he has the best temperament , but that 's nonsense .
He 's lashed out and punched down , attacking the parents of a dead soldier , a former beauty pageant winner who gained weight , countless reporters and anyone he perceives as insulting him .
It is impossible to predict exactly how deep a disaster Donald Trump 's presidency would be , but there 's no limit to the potential for horror .
Think how much we still do n't know about Trump - how he has n't released his taxes , how many women there likely are who have n't come forward - and you can imagine the scandals and corruption that lie in wait .
Consider how thin his policy knowledge is and how impulsively he reacts to insults , and imagine his twitchy little fingers on the nuclear button .
Donald Trump can not be president of the United States .
And while Trump has a considerable movement of supporters who see him as a great conquering hero , who believe every word of his lies , no matter how outlandish and easily disproven , there are many people , even at this late hour , who are torn about whether they can support him .
Maybe they 're deeply conservative Republicans who despise what they believe Clinton would do to the country .
Maybe they 're independents who see constant stories about her emails and have genuine fears about her judgment .
But now is the moment for every last American to decide what it truly means to be a citizen .
You can be reluctant about Hillary ClintonWhat you can not do is vote for Donald Trump and pretend that this is just another election , and he is just another candidate .
It is your minimum duty as a citizen not to support a racist , sexist , unqualified , dishonest , corrupt manchild who celebrates everything that 's ugly about America and not a single thing that 's great about it .
No matter how left out or left behind you feel , voting for Trump is nothing short of a moral failure .
It 's a vicious act against the human beings , mostly women and people of color , who would suffer miserably under his presidency .
It 's an act of violence against America itself , whose greatness has always been about progressing from more oppression to less - slowly , sometimes haltingly , but forward .
Watch Donald Trump 's acceptance speech after becoming the new President-elect of the United States .
Kellyanne Conway says White House `` does n't care '' about Clinton , but Trump certainly does
Only hours after President Donald Trump 's aide , Kellyanne Conway , had a fiery exchange with CNN 's Chris Cuomo over whether or not the White House was obsessed about Hillary Clinton , the president completely undercut her argument .
On Thursday morning , the president , spending his `` Executive Timewatching Disproven and paid for by Democrats `` Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign .
Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election ? ''
@ foxandfriends— Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 11 , 2018But just the night before , Conway vociferously defended Trump and insisted no one in the White House cared about Clinton .
`` We do n't care about her .
Nobody here talks about her , '' Conway said .
`` Nobody here talks about Hillary Clinton , I promise you. ``
`` We do n't care about her .
Nobody here talks about her. ``
Kellyanne Conway claimed that while many can not get over the 2016 presidential election , the White House does not talk about Hillary Clinton .

com/W73q9nZnF5— CNN ( @ CNN ) January 11 , 2018Conway also asserted that the public still had not gotten over the election and that most have n't moved on .
Trump , however , was handing out electoral maps last year '' So many people ca n't get over the election results , '' Conway said .
Cuomo fired back , `` Says my friend who ca n't keep Hillary Clinton 's name out of her mouth .
`` `` I 'll make you a deal , '' Conway said .
`` I 'll never talk about her [ Clinton ] again , but then you ca n't talk about the 2016 election .
`` `` I 'm not , I have n't mentioned the election once , '' Cuomo replied .
In recent months , Conway has tweeted about Clinton on numerous occasions herself .
It took Hillary abt 5 minutes to blame NRA for madman 's rampage , but 5 days to sorta-kinda blame Harvey Weinstein 4 his sexually assaults .

https : //t .
co/6MjMmc3q8m— Kellyanne Conway ( @ KellyannePolls ) September 5 , 2017The two continued to talk over each other , and Cuomo brought up the alleged Russian election meddling , as well as the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting in which top Trump campaign officials met with a Russian lawyer with potential ties to the Kremlin in order to receive dirt on Clinton .
`` The idea that we would have to look any further than Hillary Clinton to beat Hillary Clinton is a fantasy , '' Conway said .
The CNN host added , `` Is we inconclusive of Don Jr. , Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort , who went to a meeting with a Russian lawyer who was promising dirt on Hillary Clinton ?
`` `` And what came of that meeting ?
Absolutely nothing , '' Conway responded .
`` That 's not the point , '' Cuomo emphasized .
`` The point is why you went .
`` In essence , Conway 's behavior was a larger metaphor of the Trump presidency .
Either Conway — who delivered to America the phrase `` alternative facts '' — was deliberately lying about Trump 's personal obsession with deflecting and pointing the finger at Clinton , or she has proven yet again that the right hand still has truly no idea what the left is doing .
The exchange did n't end on television , though , continuing on Twitter Thursday morning .
So fun to see the predictable heads exploding , but I should 've finished that sentence # CuomoPrimeTime @ CNN— Kellyanne Conway ( @ KellyannePolls ) January 11 , 2018 hey kellyanne - good thing no one talks about hrc in the white house .

Leftists Blame NRA For Las Vegas Tragedy
What happened Sunday night in Las Vegas was a horrible , senseless tragedy .
Hundreds are hurt , at least 58 dead as of this writing , and a nation trying to figure out just what is going on .
Here 's a video of the concert as the attack begins : — Luke Broadlick ( @ LukeBroadlick ) October 2 , 2017Note the sound .
Sure sounds like a fully-automatic weapon which is one of the most tightly controlled weapon categories in the country .
A background check , permission from law enforcement , and national registration are just some of the hurdles one would have to go through to buy a weapon like this legally .
That does n't even touch on the massive expense of buying a legal full-auto firearm following the 1986 machine gun ban .
Weapons like that run tens of thousands of dollars , which means that alone keeps them out of most folks ' hands .
But that wo n't stop the anti-gun left .
Nope .
Blame for the tragedy rest squarely on the shoulders of the National Rifle Association .
The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots .
Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer , which the NRA wants to make easier to get .
— Hillary Clinton ( @ HillaryClinton ) October 2 , 2017Oh , sweet and fluffy Lord .
It 's a suppressor , not a silencer .
For the kinds of weapons we 're looking at being used , a suppressor is less than useless .
Further , if the shooter got a legal full-auto weapon , which is doubtful , it would n't have been a problem for him to get a suppressor .
If he got the weapons illegally , then there was nothing stopping him from getting a suppressor illegally .
Nothing was done after Sandy Hook , Orlando and now Las Vegas .
Stop kidding yourselves @ NRA— Ollie Cookson ( @ OCookson ) October 2 , 2017 Donald , and and your NRA gun nuts share responsibility for the Las Vegas massacre .
Why do civilians need military assault weapons ? — yaakovdoe ( @ YaakovDoe ) October 2 , 2017 @ NRA— Aaron Nissalke ( @ nissalke6 ) October 2 , 2017 Life comes at you fast .

The @ NRA @ realDonaldTrump # LasVegas— Sophie Ellman-Golan ( @ EgSophie ) October 2 , 2017Really , it keeps going on and on like that .
In fact , that 's only a very brief snapshot of the anti-NRA hatred being spewed .
This from the same people who routinely call for calm reflection following a terrorist attack motivated by radical Islam .
`` Do n't blame all of Islam , '' they say…but think nothing of blaming the NRA for something there 's no indication they had anything to do with .
Let me make this very clear to the leftists out there : This maniac used one of the most tightly controlled and regulated firearms in the country , one that requires every hoop imaginable to get your hands on legally , and killed dozens and wounded hundreds .
Do you really think there 's anything that would have stopped this from happening ?
Anything at all ? Especially since there are so many questions we do n't have answers to .
His brother claims he had no political affiliationsTo be sure , there 's plenty of speculation going on .
I 'm not immune to it , though I wo n't divulge my speculation publicly just now .
However , speculation is just something people do to pass the time until we have actual facts , which are severely lacking at the moment .
What matters right now is to do whatever we can to help those who have been hurt by this tragedy , either by losing someone they care about , physically wounded in the assault , or legitimately traumatized by what they 've been through .
There are victims here , and they need our love and support far more than our wild theories about what has taken place in Las Vegas .
My heart and prayers go out to all the victims and their families , as do my wife 's and children 's .
I know I 'm not alone in this , and while this is something that should unify us in solidarity if only for a few moments , it 's a shame that it wo n't .
Las Vegas Shooting : 50 Dead , 200 Wounded at Jason Aldean Concert
At least 58 people are dead and 518 more wounded after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas Sunday night .
The assailant opened fire with a fully automatic weapon just as Jason Aldean was beginning his show at the Route 91 Harvest Festival .
Videos posted on social media show Aldean , one of the biggest names in the genre , singing as very rapid gunfire begins in the background .
He can be seen running from stage as he , and the thousands in the crowd who came to see him , realized the horror of what was happening .
No matter how often these tragedies occur ( and it is far too often ) , one never goes into an event thinking it will happen then or there .
The terror is unimaginable .
In this case , it was also protracted .
A gunman continued to rain bulletsVictims ran to safety , according to NBC News , during momentary breaks in the violence , at which point the shooter presumably reloaded .
He was found on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Casino , Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said , and shot dead .
`` Right now we believe it 's a solo act , a lone wolf attacker , '' Lombardo told reporters .
`` We are pretty confident there is no longer a threat .
`` The gunman has not yet been identified .
Aldean said he was safe in an Instagram post early Monday , sharing an image of the city and asking for prayers for the victims : '' Tonight has been beyond horrific .
I still dont know what to say but wanted to let everyone know that Me and my Crew are safe .
`` `` My Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight , '' he wrote , clearly as stunned and traumatized as anyone else .
`` It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night .
`` Aldean 's wife Brittany Kerr posted her own message on Instagram , saying , `` We are safe… our angels were definitely watching over us tonight .
`` `` No words for what happened , '' she added .
`` Just horrific .
Praying for everyone .
`` Witness accounts are what you would expect - unable to fully do justice to what happened as you read this , but terrifying nonetheless .
Country star Jake Owen was one of the witnesses , having just finished his set and was still on stage when the shooting started .
`` There was blood on people and you could see a couple of people in the streets that looked like they had been shot , '' Owen added .
Ivetta Saldana told the Las Vegas Review-Journal , `` It was was a horror show .
People were standing around , then they hit the floor .
`` Robyn Webb , who was at the concert along with her husband last night , told the newspaper , `` It just kept coming .
It was relentless .
`` Authorities , meanwhile , are searching for a 62-year-old woman named Marylou Danley , whom they believe is the gunman 's roommate .
Police have searched a home in Mesquite , Nevada , 85 miles from Las Vegas , where it is believed the gunman lived with Danley .
She is considered a person of interest in the case .
UPDATE : Police have identified the assailant as Stephen Paddock , 64 .
He is shown above with his companion , Danley .
Paddock is believed to have begun his attack around 10:00 pm local time and to have continued shooting for two hours .
Police were reportedly able to locate Paddock quickly due to the smoke from his weapon setting off hotel fire detectors .
Paddock 's motives for the shooting remain unclear .
Early reports indicate that he was not a member of any militant group .
He was not known to hold extremist political or religious beliefs , though the investigation into the matter is just hours old .
Danley was apprehended for questioning at 3:40 a. m. In any case , reports indicate that several guns , including at least eight rifles , were found in the room rented by Paddock and Danley .
`` We have no idea what his belief system was , '' Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said during his press briefing early this morning .
More details to follow as this shocking story develops ... UPDATE : The death toll is now 58 and climbing , according to an ABC News report , with more than 518 people wounded .
Expect that to tragically rise as the day progresses .

Email us at [ email protected ] Obviously the big story of the day is the massacre that occurred in Las Vegas last night at a Country Music concert , where at least 50 people were killed by a man from a 32nd floor hotel room at Mandalay Bay casino .
Naturally this has already been politicized , with people arguing about immigration , gun control , and all things Trump .
Oh and Hillary said this : The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots .
Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer , which the NRA wants to make easier to get .
— Hillary Clinton ( @ HillaryClinton ) October 2 , 2017But yea , Trump is the only one who tweets dumb things .
Good thing the democrats gave us a viable alternative in 2016 that we could really get behind .
Those machine gun silencers are a real killer .
Anyway , we have no interest in going all political about this .
Maybe Jay Dub will .
Just not my cup of tea .
What we do is always find the worst people on the Internet and see what they have to say about this tragedy .
Today 's winner is an illiterate drug dealer from Hartford named Allen Lozada , AKA AP El Titere .
Here 's his initial reaction to the mass shooting : He might not have finished his GED , but he basically sees the world the same exact way 99 % of employees at CNN do - everything is Trump 's fault .
And those crackas who were peacefully watching a concert in Vegas ?
They deserved it .
The whole thing was a big setup to draw attention away from hurricane relief in Puerto Rico .
He was just getting started though : But he 's one of the good guys because he admits to donating his profits from drug transactions towards disaster relief : Oh yea , he 's a winner .
And you 'll never guess who his favorite bouncing ball team is… .

There 's gon na be a lot of talk in the days and weeks ahead about banning whatever guns were used in Las Vegas .
But I think we can all agree that what REALLY needs to be banned are flat brimmed Chicago Bulls hats and anyone who is inclined to wear them .
There are plenty of responsible , law abiding gun owners out there .
But there has never , ever , ever been a decent , law-abiding person who has chosen to wear that thing on their head .
If you know anyone that owns that hat , disassociate with them immediately .
They will only bring you down .
He even rocks the Chicago Bulls winter hat when he 's pouring out some Henny for the homeys in the January : Easy on the Henny Allen - it 's not good for your bowels : I know when I die I want people to come to my headstone and drink copious amounts of Red Bull and Henny , the nectar of the hoodrats .
He really misses his boy , who I 'm sure lived a noble and worthwhile life , because now that Sito is n't around , he does n't have anyone to come scoop him up to he can `` turn up on these fuck n words '' : You can also find Allen Lozada on Deadbeatdirectory .
comOh good , he 's a cokehead deadbeat `` dad , '' who allegedly threatened to choke his baby until she turned blue .
Shocking .
Especially considering his overall philosophy on women : When he eventually gets killed by a cop and SJWs pretend like his death is an actual loss to the community , he wants you to commemorate him by burning Hartford to the ground : He 's very familiar with the inside of a courthouse : He lives the good life by cashing in his SSI check for stays at the Marriott : Last year things were beginning to look up for Allen .
He was trying to stay out of the police logs , and gave himself one Internet cookie for going a full month without stabbing , shooting , or running over someone with a car : He gets another Internet cookie for going four days sober : And he 's going legit because the `` feds out here snatching everybody '' : Also this : I have no idea what that means , but it sounds important .
VERY important .
Anyway , it is gon na be interesting to see what the killer 's motivation was in Las Vegas .
He shot at a country music festival .
A place that more than likely was filled with people who voted for Donald Trump .
Not saying that 's his motive , but he could 've shot up any large group of people and he chose this one .
Just sayin .
Either way , Allen Lozada is a useless sack of gutterpubes , and the 50+ who died in Las Vegas are much , much bigger losses to society than he could ever be .

Shoutout To This Father-Son Duo Who Avenged Their Daughter/Sister 's Death By Kidnapping And Kicking The Shit Out Of Her Heroin Hookup Until He Named Names

TrashliveThe man was able to escape the slow-moving van on Baldwin Hill Road , whereupon both Lombardis allegedly followed him out and continued the attack , which residents of the street observed and reported to police , who intervened in a quick response .
I do n't normally condone vigilantism , but at the same time , we 're living in a state filled to the brim with Deval Patrick judges that let scumbags out onto the street time and time again .
Some times you just got ta do what you got ta do .
Nah mean ?
Big shoutout to this father and son duo who realized that this was the only way they were going to receive any sort of satisfaction .
There 's no way the idiot they kidnapped ever saw it coming either .
There 's a reason it was just the son that was supposed to show up .
The Dad looks like he done killed 4-5 people before .
Plus his name is Ralph .
I do n't fuck with guys named Ralph who wear shirts like that .
That 's just common sense .
Meanwhile the son appears to be your average Berkshire hippie jock who is no stranger to craft beer festivals : Never in a million years did the `` victim '' think that guy right there was gon na kidnap him in a van and waterboard him to kingdom come until he named names .
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again - there is no one more gutless than a heroin dealer .
Pot dealers are great , and coke dealers I do n't have strong opinions on .
Know why ?
Because they do their own product .
Heroin dealers do n't .
Because they 'd be dead pretty quickly .
If you ca n't stand by your product then you 're a piece of shit .
People who sell heroin are choad monkeys because they KNOW they 're profiting off of the self-destruction of another person .
There has never , ever , ever been a positive affect of heroin .
Ever .
You are selling poison to stupid and vulnerable people who do n't know any better .
You are the lowest of the low .
Granted the guy they kicked the shit out of was n't the actual dealer .
But he knew who the dealer was and it was time to name names .
This is the only way to get that information .
Big props for doing it mafia style too by using a van , and telling the idiot they picked up that they were gon na magically fix his debt problems .
The only surprising part about this story is that they got caught in Egremont .
Egremont is easily top 5 places to dump a body in Massachusetts .
Ever been there before ?
It 's a real trip .
Nestled next to Alford , Mount Washington ( there 's a town called Mount Washington ) , New York state , and the metropolis of Great Barrington , there 's no reason for anyone to ever go to Egremont .
Ever .
The fact that this nudnik jumped out of the van and people were actually there to see it is nothing less than a statistical miracle .
I do n't wan na say that father and son are heroes , but they kind of just revolutionized the opiate epidemic .
If you sell heroin , you no longer get a free pass from some SJW judge .
You get old school punishment from the family .
At least that might present a detriment for potential dealers down the road .

Trumpocalypse : The End Game
You can see where this is headed , the once bright and shiny democracy going down the drain before the holidays are out .
The Russians , the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and his agents , desperate men flipped and singing to save their souls — all may soon be gone , by President Trump 's design .
If there 's any outrage left in the tank , use it now , because Trump has signaled exactly what he 's going to do .
First , he had to set some brush fires , impugning the legitimacy of the rule of law — an old dictator 's trick .
Trump is no Hitler , but when the German Reichstag burned in 1933 , it was all the Nazis needed to gut civil liberties .
So , before Trump can fire the prosecutor who is hot on the corruption trail of those in the president 's inner circle , he needs a pretext .
He could just work his way down the line at the Justice Department , until he found a quisling willing to remove the special counsel .
But before he gets to that , he has to delegitimize the whole investigation .
Thus , he 's now attacking the F. B. I. , saying the agency is in `` Tatters '' and its standing `` the worst in History. ``
Bashing cops — was n't that what those Black Lives Matter people did to disrespect Blue Lives ? Thank God we have Sarah Huckabee Sanders as a moral clarion in a crisis .
`` When you 're attacking F. B. I. agents because you 're under criminal investigation , you 're losing , '' she tweeted .
Sorry — that was Sarah Huckabee Sanders of a year ago , before she was paid to defend the liar in chief .
Trump 's lawyer , John Dowd , has been busy clearing out more brush , making the preposterous claim that the president can not obstruct justice because he 's the nation 's chief law enforcement officer .
If Trump shot somebody on Fifth Avenue — his own suggested redline — he could , as the nation 's chief law enforcement officer , tell the cops to quash the investigation .
See , when the president does it , it 's not a crime .
This defense was floated during the two impeachment episodes of the 20th century .
The third time will not be a charm .
But Trump 's team already has gone from there is no collusion or obstruction to , so what ?
If it happened , it 's no biggie .
They do n't appear to be the least bit troubled by a stunning report from a whistle-blower .
As Trump was pledging to put America first during his Inaugural Address , his national security adviser , Michael Flynn , was texting a former business associateIgnoring that story , Trump 's media wing is doing its job .
Sean Hannity , at state-run television , went on a vein-popping rant Tuesday against law enforcement , complete with conspiracy charts .
He called the federal authorities `` a team of so-called investigators. ``
As for their boss , he said that `` Mueller is frankly a disgrace to the American justice system and has put the country on the brink of becoming a banana republic. ``
He 's certainly learned the art of projection from his master .
The Wall Street Journal , channeling its owner and Trump whisperer Rupert Murdoch , has been making much of the same case , albeit without the spittle .
Do n't forget , this is the same Robert Mueller who won wide bipartisan praise when he was appointed special counsel : a career prosecutor , the longest-serving director of the F. B. I. since J. Edgar Hoover , awarded the Bronze Star for his service as a Marine in Vietnam .
Republicans love him .
Or they did until he started closing in on Trump 's closest associates .
Mueller should be fired , the Russian enablers now claim , because one of his agents said some bad things about Trump .
This agent , Peter Strzok , was reassigned over the summer , as soon as his comments came to light .
Wow , a G-man has opinions .
The cops I know , a couple of longstanding friends , have more opinions than I .
The facts are what matter .
And the facts are pointing in a very bad direction for the gang that ca n't collude straight .
Trump has got to be sweating it ; he was said to be `` seething '' when two of his campaign aides were indicted and a third pleaded guilty in October .
He looked punch-drunk at recent public events .
Now that he 's a felon from a guilty plea last week , Flynn is cooperating with Mueller .
He knows plenty .
Trump could pardon him and try to bring him back into the fold .
The outrage would be minimal among the Banana Republicans .
Sure , they got their tax-relief-for-the-rich bill passed , so they may no longer need Trump after he signs it .
But now they 're dreaming of more — cutting Medicare and health care for children , so they have a reason to keep him around .
If Trump fires Mueller , he can start the new year clean .
His base will stick with him .
Though voters believe , by a nearly 2-1 margin , that Russians interfered with the United States election , Republicans do not
‘ Serial misconduct and perversion ' : Trump accusers describe incidents ‘ a thousand times worse than what Franken has done '
A total of 16 women joined together Monday to address their stories of sexual assault and sexual harassment at the hands of President Donald Trump .
While many of these women came forward during the 2016 election , the Trump campaign attacked them , their lives and many right-wing activists invented information designed to discredit them .
The three women that spoke earlier to Megyn Kelly '' There was one man that was n't being held accountable — who 's not being called out , '' Greenwald said .
That 's why he decided to create the documentary with the women .
`` It really had an impact on your heart , your soul , your emotions , '' Greenwald said .
He noted that so many women came forward to warn Americans , but `` attention was not paid .
`` Today , Greenwald said `` we know better .
We know a lot better , '' when it comes to predators .
He demanded those in politics to act against anyone of either party not to give anyone `` a pass .
`` Jessica Leeds , Samantha Holvey and Rachel Crooks each introduced themselves , telling story after story of their horrifying encounters with Trump .
`` I have a new dream now that this man will be held accountable for his actions and that future women will not be treated as less than just because they are a woman , '' Holvey said .
Crooks noted that given Trump owned the building in which she worked , she did n't have any power to do anything .
She went on to say that it was only through other remarkably similar accounts that she felt empowered to come forward .
`` Instead , this was serial misconduct and perversion on the part of Mr. Trump , '' Crooks continued .
`` Unfortunately , this behavior is n't rare in our society .
Many women of any background can be victims .
The only reason I am here today is because this offender is the president of our country .
`` She went on to note that Trump had dismissed his `` Access Hollywood '' tape as `` locker room talk , '' but `` having been the victim of such actions , I knew better .
`` She asked that some things should transcend politics and that all people , regardless of position or power be held accountable for their actions , including Trump .
Leeds walked through her disgusting story and further encounter '' The United States is a big strong country , '' Leeds said that she thought at the time .
`` We can survive this person .
`` But women kept coming up to her in public and told Leeds their own story .
She said that she had hoped things were better for women in business , but `` apparently I was wrong. ``
When the Harvey Weinstein story hit and woman after woman began to come forward , people were finally being held accountable .
`` Except for our president , '' Leeds said .
She quoted Trump 's White House , who has said that the women are all `` liars. ``
She noted that some are holding men accountable for bad behavior , however , `` our president is not being held accountable for what he is and who he is .
`` Leeds said that this is part of the problem that is happening in Alabama .
Crooks agreed , saying that Trump endorsed Roy Moore because he denied the allegations and it `` worked for him .
`` Lisa Boyne spoke via phone to the press conference , telling her own story of being invited to a dinner party with Trump in the West Village .
She said that he wanted the women to rate other women on a 1 to 10 scale .
While at dinner , the men used the table as a `` casting couch. ``
The women were brought to the table one by one and he told them to walk across the table .
Boyne said that Trump looked up their skirts as they walked by .
She said that John Casablancas ordered her to drink more but she refused and he was bothered by her refusal .
She ultimately excused herself to the ladies room and from the restaurant .
She explained that over the years her story was met with shame and questions of why she was there .
She tried to pitch it to reporters , but no one wanted to hear it .
`` As a parent I was so deeply deeply offended… because he had a son around the age of my son and what sort of values are we teaching our children when we say that something like rape is ‘ locker room talk , ' '' she shouted .
`` And that her husband talking about that is ‘ boy talk . '
Everybody is normalizing as something that boys and men say in the locker room .
That is the talk of horrible people and Trump keeps staying it to the press pool .
And you 're all taking it in like it 's normal .
It is not a normal way for people to talk .
Why are n't people calling him out on that .
Something that is so horrific — I 'm so fed up of listening to people .
We take it in like it 's nothing .
We should n't teach our boys to talk like this .
`` She went on to say it was `` one thousand times worse that what Al Franken has done .

PHOTOS : Aftermath of Hurricane Irma at Walt Disney World
UPDATE : 09/12/17This morning Walt Disney World opened its gates to all four theme parks to guests .
Even though the parks looked immaculate , several attractions were closed today ( or delayed ) due to debris caused by Hurricane Irma .
We walked around Magic Kingdom to see if we could identify the causes behind these delays .
Walt Disney World Railroad has trees down across the tracks .
Tom Sawyer Island is also currently closed due to Hurricane Irma 's after effects .
Jungle Cruise has also been reported as needing at least a week to remove the debris before it can be operational .
*********************************************************Hurricane Irma passed over Walt Disney World last night and has since turned into a Tropical Storm .
Florida curfew remains in effect until 6pm today for Osceola and Orange counties .
Approximately 300,000 are without power in Orange Country alone .
Luckily we have not heard of any of the Walt Disney World Resorts losing power overnight .
WFTV 9 ABC News reported earlier this morning seeing a `` load '' of tour buses pass them by .
It appears they were carrying linemen to EPCOT to help get the power back on .
Lights remain on at Walt Disney World and damage appears minimal https : //t .

Beautiful day outside .
Perfect weather for Worcester 's Mayor Moron , Joe Petty , to do a standout with his communist friend Red Danny Margolis : Ya got that ?
The mayor of the second largest city in Worcester is working hand in hand with a guy who admittedly is trying to foment communist revolutionWiki page '' Dan Margolis was born in Worcester , Massachusetts , in 1976 .
In 2006 he was chair of the New York State Communist Party USAPeople 's WorldCommunist Party USAHe has his own page on the American Communist Party 's website '' The Communist Party can exercise a leadership role by helping to show the importance of electing or defending Democrats as part of an overall strategy on the road towards socialism .
`` Communism only appeals to people in impoverished areas where they have given up and believe capitalism has failed them .
Thus why Mayor Petty seems inclined on making Worcester 's people trapped in cycles of poverty .
It 's why he wants to make Worcester a sanctuary city - so we can lose $ 59 million in federal funding .
Red Danny was pumped when Obama won , and as the chairman of the Communist Party of New York , he gave the following statement , claiming that this was the `` biggest continuation of that revolutionary spirit '' : Where he expressed how bad he thinks the collapse of communism has been for the Russian people : Soviet Union obviously had problems , but now there are drugs , poverty , and unemployment .
Life has gotten worse for the Russian people .
Gangsters are running the streets .
Actually , now Communist Parties are voted back to power by the people in such places like Moldova , Belarus , and Chech Republic .
People did n't like the shock therapy that Yeltsin had introduced .
Boris Yeltsin once stood on a tank and protected the legitimate government from armed communists trying to stage a coups .
Naturally Dan is not a fan of Boris Yeltsin .
All of this information is public .
Just a Google away for any responsible leader .
Joe knows exactly who Red Danny is but he employs him on his campaign team anyway because he 's a useful idiot .
One of his `` morons .
`` He knows that Red Danny has his own blog where he makes up lies about Turtleboy Sports raping girls and blah , blah , blah .
He also knows that Red Danny is OBSESSED with Councilor Michael Gaffney .
And together Turtleboy and Gaffney are a HUGE threat to Petty 's grip on the taxpayer 's money .
He ai n't giving that up without a fight , and he has no problem using communist revolutionaries .
There 's a good chance he actually HIRED Dan to write his silly little blogs .
Do n't worry though - within a couple days he 'll write another blog denying that Petty hired him .
He a good soldier like that .
But a picture does n't lie : Oh , and did we mention that Dan Margolis is also running the failed Turtleboycott campaign that harasses local businesses ?
The same businesses that Mayor Moron claims he wants to attract and keep in the city .
Here 's the best part - he voted for his buddy Red Danny to be appointed to the Library BoardThe City Council Tuesday night elected Daniel M. Margolis of 15 Rugby St. to the Worcester Public Library Board of Directors .
Mr. Margolis was one of three candidates who sought to fill a vacancy on the library for for a term that expires on Dec. 31 , 2019 .
Mr. Margolis received six votes , followed by Edward R. Carr who received four votes and Paul DePalo who received one vote .
The two people who Red Danny beat ?
Edward R. Carr has a PhDPaul DePalo is a lawyer with 12 years of experienceNot just him either - Councilors Khrystian King , Kate Toomey , George Russell , Tony Economou , and Candy Carlson all voted for him as well .
Every single one of them has the power to Google , and they all read Turtleboy .
They knew EXACTLY who they were voting for .
And yes , you read that right - Sarai `` Titi Ho '' Rivera did not vote to put Danny in .
Even though he 's got her back till the cows come home : This is the state of the city right now .
People like Red Danny are allowed to serve in our government - an admitted , openly communist revolutionary .
People like Etel Haxhiaj get appointed to the CAC under Petty 's watch , and deny ANYONE who `` supports '' Turtleboy Sports a job they are overly qualified for on city boards .
Make no doubt about it - Petty is the mastermind here .
Red Danny , Etel , Mosaic - these are just his goons .
Because Petty does a great job of convincing everyone he 's this `` nice guy '' because he does n't get his hands dirty .
Some people thinks Gaffney is a dick because he fights his own battles .
Not Petty though .
He just outsources to labor to nudniks with nothing to lose like Red Danny .
But make no doubt about it - Dan Magolis is his right hand man and by far his biggest asset .
This is what a vote for Mayor Moron is a vote for in November .
Vote the Turtleboy Ticket : Mayor - Mike GaffneyCouncilors at Large : Gaffney , Konnie LukesD3 : Davis AssareD4 : Coreen GaffneyD5 : Paul FrancoSchool Committee : Everyone except Dante Comparetto .

TIME FOR A CHANGE . The Energy Report 01/02/18
The world Is watching and so is oil as the death toll rises in the streets of Iran , where the people revolt against a terrible economy and the lack of any real freedoms and rights .
At least 19 people were reported killed in street protests in Iran , while President Hassan Rouhani on one hand defended their right to protest but on the other hand warned he would show `` no tolerance '' for those who incite unrest .
Many arrests have been made and the government of Iran says it may seek the death penalty , for what they say are crimes against God , in demonstrations that have gone on for over 5 days in a row .
President Trump tweeted that `` Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration .
The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years .
They are hungry for food & for freedom .
Along with human rights , the wealth of Iran is being looted .
TIME FOR CHANGE !
`` The uprising in IRAN is just another risk factor in a global oil market that is tightening .
Strong global demand and shale oil production that is falling far short of what the Energy Information keeps telling us it is .
Reports from the Texas Railroad Commission is telling us that Texas shale oil production has been stagnant and not rising as the production decline rate year over year is taking its toll .
Total oil stocks are down a whopping 135M barrels just since April even as U. S. oil production is supposedly at a record high .
Bad data is becoming a bigger risk as underinvestment has led to the least amount of oil discoveries in 70 years and the global oil replenishment rate ratio fell to 11 percent this year , down from more than 50 percent in 2012 according to a new report .
That is a dangerous situation , especially because of the over estimates of shale oil output .
ETF reports that this has led to the lowest ever volumes of oil discoveries in 2017 , Rystad Energy said last week .
While the low-level of discoveries is not an immediate threat to global oil supply , it could become a threat ten years down the road , according to Rystad Energy .
In ten years ' time , U. S. shale production may peak , at least according to OPEC that sees shale peaking after 2025 , although the cartel has conceded that U. S. tight oil has defied previous forecasts and has increased production more than initially expected and will continue to do so in the short-term .
This year has seen less than 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent discovered globally , a volume as low as last seen in the 1940s , Rystad Energy has estimated .
What worries analysts the most is the fact that this year the reserve replacement ratio-the amount of discovered resources relative to the amount of production-was a mere 11 percent , compared to 50 percent in 2012 , Sonia Mladá Passos , Senior Analyst at Rystad Energy , said .
The other ongoing risk is Venezuela .
An explosion over the weekend that hit Venezuela 's largest refinery was an accident waiting to happen .
Deferred maintenance and bad management as the Venezuelan government stole money and failed to do even the most basic maintenance for the facility according to sources .
Reuters reported that a former oil minister excoriated Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a newspaper column on Sunday , accusing the leftist leader of behaving like biblical King Herod and plunging the oil-rich nation into economic devastation .
Rafael Ramirez , who was the all-powerful head of the oil ministry and state energy company PDVSA for a decade , has long been a rival of Maduro .
In recent months , Ramirez has grown increasingly critical of Maduro 's handling of a fourth straight year of recession that has triggered malnutrition , widespread food and medicine shortages , the world 's steepest inflation , and a surge in emigration .
A furious Maduro ordered Ramirez to resign as the nation 's United Nations ambassador in New York last month after an article entitled the `` The Storm '' was perceived as an attack on his government .
The Energy Report has kept our bullish outlook and we still believe that the double bottom at $ 26 a barrel was a generational low .
Despite all the bearish hype that the market had last year and bad info this year oil looks poised for a big move .
Make sure you are hedged !
I am hearing from many folks still that were underhedged last year and are now paying the price .

The Truth Story Behind The Clintons Relationship : Revealed
Before you judge Hillary Clinton as a Republican presidential candidate , you should have all your information .
Not only is she representing what every woman could strive to become , but the personal love story of the Clintons will tug at your heartstrings .
Bill and Hillary 's love story started very appropriately - in a college class of political and civil rights .
Bill claims that Hillary had a sense of `` self-possession and strength '' that he found magnetic .
Hillary Clinton was the one to approach Bill , saying , `` You know , if you 're going to keep looking at me , and I 'm going to keep looking back , we should know each other .
I 'm Hillary Rodham '' .

1st Amendment
The 1st Amendment is the most well known to Americans of all the amendments in the Bill of Rights .
It contains some of the most familiar phrases in political discussion , such as freedom of religion , freedom of speech and freedom of the press .
The 1st Amendment reads like this : `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances .
`` The 1st Amendment protects your right to believe and practice whatever religious principles you choose and your right to say what you believe , even if it is unpopular or against the will of elected officials .
It also protects your right to publish any information you want , join together with whomever you want and ask the government to correct its own errors .
What exactly does the 1st Amendment mean and how does it apply to people today ?
Does it have relevance to you today ?
It sure does .
In fact , it affects just about everything you do .
The 1st Amendment has seven clauses .
This page has a brief description of each clause with links to more detailed information about the history and purpose of each section .
The Opening Phrase of the 1st Amendment says `` Congress shall make no law. ``
This opening phrase immediately tells exactly who this amendment is aimed at ... and that entity is Congress .
So the 1st Amendment specifically prohibits Congress from making laws interfering with the rights mentioned in the amendment .
It does not however , prohibit the states from making such laws , nor does it prohibit individuals from restricting these rights to those who may be under their authority , such as a parent and child or an employer and an employee .
For one hundred years the 1st Amendment was understood to only apply to the federal government , but after the Civil War and the 14th Amendment was added to the Constitution , courts began to forbid the states to interfere with these rights as well due to an idea called `` due process of law .
`` Learn more about the Opening Phrase of the 1st AmendmentThe Establishment Clause is the part of the 1st Amendment that says Congress shall make no law `` respecting an establishment of religion. ``
This is a very crucial part of the American ConstitutionThis clause has been the focus of much debate in the last half century .
Some Americans believe that whenever the government is involved , absolutely all religious expression must be forbidden in order to comply with the Establishment Clause .
For example , they might say a public school football team should not pray at a football game because the school is a government funded school .
Other Americans believe the government must make certain allowances for religious expressions in public events and buildings because Americans are a very religious people .
They belive a high school football team prayer or a government employee displaying a cross at work does not violate the Establishment Clause because it is simply a personal expression and not an expression endorsed by the state .
Indeed , in the minds of some , banning expressions of religious faith like this is a violation of another clause of the 1st Amendment - the Free Exercise Clause , because it seeks to control the religious expressions of citizens .
Learn more about the history and purpose of the Establishment ClauseThe Free Exercise Clause is the part of the 1st Amendment that says Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or `` the free exercise thereof. ``
This phrase deals with the restriction on Congress to regulate anyone 's religious practices .
In general , Congress can not tell people how they can or can not express their religious beliefs .
Such things as telling people when or how to pray , when they should go to church or to whom they should pray , are off limits to lawmakers .
In general , this is the case , but sometimes , minority religious groups may want to practice something that is not generally accepted or that the state has a very strong interest in regulating .
For example , polygamy , ritual sacrifice and drug usage have been banned at times , because there is a compelling public interest in eliminating these behaviors .
In such cases , the Supreme Court has often ruled that the Free Exercise Clause does not apply .
In other words , the Free Exercise Clause does not give free license to any behavior that someone says is their religious belief .
You can learn all about the Free Exercise ClauseThe Freedom of Speech Clause is the part of the 1st Amendment that says , `` Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech .
`` British history contained a long string of suppression by those in authority of those with whom they disagreed .
Many British subjects had been thrown in prison for voicing their religious and political beliefs .
The Americans intended to prevent this from ever happening in their newly formed republic .
This is one of the protections in the Constitution that Americans hold most dear .
They value it because it allows them to speak out against government policies they do n't like .
It also allows them to express the religious beliefs of their choosing .
Negatively speaking , many people abuse this right by slandering people they disagree with , or using ugly and offensive language , racial epithets or hateful language about people who are different than they are .
Generally , freedom of speech is considered to be not only the words people speak , but any type of expression that is used to convey an idea .
Such things as picketing , wearing symbols or burning the flag are considered protected forms of speech because they are expressing the ideas of the people participating in them .
You can learn more about the Freedom of Speech ClauseThe Freedom of the Press Clause states that `` Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom ... of the press .
`` This was a very important principle to the Founding FathersWithout the press , the Founding Fathers would have found it very difficult to distribute their views to people in other parts of the country .
The press turned out to be a very important instigation in getting Americans to consolidate their views against England and in spreading the concepts that would justify a break with England .
English history contained no freedoms for the press whatsoever .
All publications were subject to governmental review before publication .
Criticisms of the government were strictly prosecuted as sedition .
All Americans wanted the right to criticize their government freely as well as to discuss other topics whenever they chose .
If you would like to learn more about the Freedom of the Press ClauseThe Freedom of Assembly Clause is the part of the First Amendment that reads like this : `` Congress shall make no law ... abridging ... the right of the people peaceably to assemble ... `` This clause is also sometimes referred to as the Freedom of Association Clause .
This clause protects the right to assemble in peace to all Americans .
The Freedom of Assembly was very important to early Americans because without the right to assemble , they could not coordinate their opposition to the British government .
The Freedom of Assembly was recognized to be of utmost importance if the Americans were to be successful in establishing a government of the people .
The Freedom of Assembly Clause has been relied upon by many groups in American history , such as civil rights groups , women 's suffrage groups and labor unions .
Government officials in each case tried to restrict the speech of these groups and prevent them from meeting , organizing and getting their message out .
The Freedom of Assembly proved to be an important factor that allowed these groups to prosper and see their visions fulfilled .
You can learn more about the history and importance of the Freedom of Assembly ClauseThe Freedom of Petition Clause of the 1st Amendment reads like this : `` Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom ... of the people ... to petition the Government for a redress of grievances .
`` The freedom to petition the government was very important to early Americans because of their experience with trying to get King George III and Parliament to respond to their grievances .
The colonists were so angry about the Monarchy 's refusal to acknowledge their grievances that they mentioned this fact in the Declaration of IndependenceThe freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances has come to include the right to do such things as picketing , protesting , conducting peaceful sitins or boycotts and addressing government officials through any media available .

Councilor Mike Gaffney Quotes Voltaire About Free Speech , Failed Reporter Buttmunch Billy Shaner Says He Was Quoting A White Supremacist
Councilor Mike Gaffney Quotes Voltaire About Free Speech , Failed Reporter Buttmunch Billy Shaner Says He Was Quoting A White SupremacistWant to advertise with Turtleboy ?
Email us at Turtleboysports @ gmail .
com for more information .
Yesterday Worcester City Councilor Michael Gaffney wrote a letter to Turtleboy about his disgust towards Worcester Magazine Editor Walter Bird for the way Bird sexually harasses and tries to hook up with womenBut why did Councilor Gaffney wait until now to release this damning information ?
Well , he was probably mad that Buttmunch Billy Shaner , his newest minimum wage reporter , insinuated in the recent copy of their free newspaper that Councilor Gaffney subscribed to white nationalist ideologyYIKES : Quoting a white supremacist is not the best look , especially after one of them rammed a car into a group of people , killing one and injuring 19 .
With that in mind , I bring you a recent article in the Worcester Independent Leaderdisputedas to whether he , in fact , said itKevin Alfred StromSo let me get this straight .
Gaffney gives a completely applicable quote about the dangers of censoring free speech , which he and most other people attribute to Voltaire - the philosopher whose writings most historians agree was a driving force in the American Revolution .
And what does Billy do ?
He goes out of his way to turn this into Gaffney quoting a white supremacist .
For the record , even the far left attributes this quote to Voltaire : Voltaire : `` To learn who rules over you , simply find out who you are not allowed to criticise '' # JeSuisCharliepic .
twitter .
com/uAK8KF3C6i— Sam Sussex ( @ SamSussex ) January 8 , 2015So do Palestinians who want to criticize Israel : To learn who rules over you , simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize .
-Voltaire # GazaUnderAttackpic .
twitter .
com/k3yt6jzHNH— Persia ( ر ) ( @ persiatx ) August 13 , 2014So did Trump 's lucky sperm : To find out who rules over you , simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize .
Voltaire— Donald Trump Jr. ( @ DonaldJTrumpJr ) April 25 , 2013This is what you get when you Google image that quote : In other words , everyone thinks Voltaire said this .
No one knows for sure if he did or did n't .
All we do know is that a random white supremacist from West Virginia also wrote it hereAnyone with a brain could see what Buttmunch Billy was trying to do here .
He does n't like Gaffney because he 's a social justice warrior .
He tries to play if off like he 's just `` reporting the news '' but he does n't do a very good job hiding it .
Keep in mind that the Turtlegram and Gazette called Gaffney a `` slave master '' Juicy ! ! !
Walter Bird did n't write the blurb , but his newest employee did .
I 'm sure Walter appreciates Buttmunch Billy dragging him into a world of shit that is Turtleboy blowback .
But what choice did Gaffney have ?
We 're the only media outlet in town that tells the truth .
The rest are clearly against him , so why should he place nice with them any longer ?
Either way , Walter is the editor .
He approved of this .
He allowed his newest employee to insinuate that the Vice Chairman of the City Council quotes white supremacists .
Buttmunch Billy quickly objected on Gaffney 's Facebook page : Yea Mike .
He did n't actually call you a racist .
He just insinuated that you are inspired by white supremacist literature and freely quote them in order to push your agenda in Worcester .
What 's the harm ?
YIKES !
! Instead of just apologizing and admitting he fucked up , Buttmunch Billy doubled down and said that he was NOT insinuating any racism on his part : Yea dude , no one believes you .
You 're not good at lying .
You do n't go out of your way to research a meme 's origins , and then attribute it solely to a white supremacist , unless you 're trying to tie Gaffney to that particular white supremacist .
We 're not as stupid as you are .
Plus , who cares ? Yea , there 's no consequences to being tied to a controversial white supremacist just a couple days after one of them murdered a woman with his car .
It 's not like Joe Petty and his mindless followers will use that against him .
Oh wait… .
.
`` Councilor Gaffney quotes white supremacist .
`` That 's the story now .
That 's how it will be told from this point forward .
Buttmunch Billy knew this , which is why he wrote it in the first place .
But it 's not his fault : '' It 's not on me the way partisans choose to use my reporting .
`` See ?
He was just reporting the facts by going out of his way to suggest that Gaffney quoted a Nazi .
Not his fault how people react to that .
Kind of like how people like Billy do n't blame Trump when his supporters do fucked up shit .
Many accused him of racebaiting , but Buttmunch Billy once again disagreed : Yea , totally not race-baiting .
White supremacy has nothing do with race .
Then things got even juicier : Busted ! ! !
Apparently Billy was texting Gaffney wanting to know why a post from one of his trolls named Eric Malouin was deleted : Notice the face he forgot to crop out after he screenshotted : Oh I see now - it was a group effort from Worcester Magazine .
No wonder Gaffney wanted to spill the bins on their boss - they conspire to make him look bad and they got caught in the act .
Nice going Billy .
So that means Lyford was watching this all go down , started screenshotting his boy Eric 's troll comments , and then cried about it to Buttmunch Billy when Gaffney blocked him .
Because Josh was too much of a pussy to confront Gaffney himself .
Sad .
It looks as if the local African-American community was not impressed with their race baiting : Boom .
Roasted .
Once Gaffney threatened to spill the bins on Walter 's sexting scandal , Billy realized he fucked up .
He 's only been on the job a couple months and his childish vendetta was about to lead to the public humiliation of his boss .
So he was all like , `` Why not focus on my behavior ?
`` Because Walter allowed this to happen .
What you write reflects upon him .
When South Shore Turtlegirl offends large groups of people they go after the brand , not the blogger .
We all own it together .
It 's OK though , because `` Worcesteria '' is `` irreverent .
`` Yea , it 's just a joke Mike ! !
So I called you a white supremacist .
Big deal snowflake ! !
His `` friend '' thought it was funny : At least he understands that without doing stuff like this no one would actually read his columns : I hate to even give Buttmunch Billy attention he so dearly craves .
He writes about us EVERY SINGLE WEEK .
Or so I 'm told , I do n't read it myself .
My grandmother calls me about it on her landline .
He 's baiting for us to write about him because he 's smart enough to realize that becoming a Turtleboy villain will at least make him somewhat relevant .
But now he 's finally got our attention .
Unfortunately for him he was completely exposed for being the fraud that he is , and his boss might lose his job .

Terry Crews : 'Men Need to Hold Other Men Accountable '
Terry Crews , photographed Nov. 2017 .
Billy & Hells for TIMEWhen dozens of women came forward with sexual assault and harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein—who has continued to deny all allegations of non-consensual sex—actor Terry Crews noticed that some people on Twitter were skeptical .
Crews knows from personal experience how hard it is to experience harassment and muster the courage to speak out : He says he was groped by William Morris Endeavor agent Adam Venit at an industry event in front of his wife .
The agency said they suspended and demoted Venit , who declined to comment for this article .
He has since returned to work .
Crews is now suing Venit and the agency for sexual assault .
Crews—who was recognized as one of the Silence Breakers , TIME 's Person of the Year—realized that men had a responsibility to lend credence and support to these women 's claims .
Almost without thinking through the consequences , Crews tweeted out his own story ; in his viral series of tweets , he became one of the first men to join the chorus of women speaking out about harassment .
Crews spoke to TIME about the reception to his story and why it 's imperative that men advocate for women 's rights .
What was the moment you decided to speak out about what happened to you ? I 'd actually just read a comment someone made on Twitter about one of Weinstein 's accusers .
It went something like : She 's just looking for attention and a payday .
It really affected me .
I could n't stop thinking about it .
I remember going to my phone and I started writing .
And I could n't stop .
What it became was this sixteen-tweet missive from me .
I just remember having to say what I felt .
I was really angry because these women were being discounted .
These women were being discarded .
Their pain was just—it was nothing .
I wanted to join in .
I wanted to say something .
I wanted to support .
But I did have to let these women know they were n't alone .
And that I understood .
My whole mission was to give them strength .
Do n't accept the shame that people are giving you .
Because that 's what it was .
They were being shamed .
They were being victimized again .
I just could n't stand for it .

And I had a realization : I did n't check with my wife , I did n't check with my publicist , I did n't check with anybody .
I just did it .
But at that moment , I was free .
Until men stand up and say , `` This harassment , this abuse , these assaults are wrong , '' nothing will change .
If I was silent , it would mean I 'm consenting to all of it .
I always have felt women have been able to take care of themselves , 100 % .
But men need to hold other men accountable .
That 's my thing .
I came up in the cult of masculinity , in football and the sports world and entertainment .
You 're in places and guys are saying the wildest thing .
People need to be called on that .
You need to be held accountable for the things you say , the things you do .
What it came from is literally a belief that as a man you are more valuable than a woman .
The reason I have the authority to say it is because I was like it .
I truly believed I was more valuable than my wife and kids .
Until I had a major paradigm shift in my own life—it was like I hit rock bottom in order for me to see that I had it all wrong .
What would you say to people who think this is becoming a witch hunt ? Hollywood was so far into the fact that everyone thought this behavior is normal .
It needs to swing all the way back .
What we need is a reset .
People say , `` Oh , it 's a witch hunt .
People could lie. ``
You know what ?
First of all , the thread of that is going to keep people right .
We need to know you ca n't do it .

If there are actual witches there , we need to stop them .
I have people coming to me saying , `` Hey , man .
You could ruin this guy 's life. ``
Very clever .
That 's a very clever thing to say .
But he ruined it when he did it .
All these people need to be disciplined into knowing what is acceptable and what is n't .
The only way to do that is by holding people accountable every time .
This is something that gives my life meaning .
There 's no reason why—why should I be the guy to survive Flint , Michigan ; survive forty-nine years on this Earth ; married twenty-eight years with five kids , the whole thing—and then I just sit in my big house and relax .
This gives my life meaning .
Now I know why I was put here .
Let me tell you—the guy who messed with me messed with the wrong guy .
Is Hollywood a microcosm for how power is imbalanced in the rest of the world ? I believe that .
It is in every field , in every business , in sports , in politics .
It 's bipartisan .
It 's not Democratic , it 's not Republican , it 's not Russian , it 's not American , it 's not black , it 's not white .
Because I am an African-American man , I 've been just as vocal about the abuses in my own community .
The pimp culture , where guys are praised for having two or three girls .
I 've been to the rally for civil rights , and they will look at a woman and say , `` Bitch , sit down. ``
And you 're like , `` Wait a minute—this is civil rights here. ``
When it 's like , as a black man , I 'm equal to a white man , but they do n't believe that a man is equal to a woman .
Self-defeating .
Self-destructive .
How are you going to get justice , and you are n't even treating the women in your circle with justice ?
If you 're a Democrat , you ca n't gloss over your own problems of the people in your party .
If you 're a Republican , you ca n't gloss over those problems in your party .
If you 're American , you ca n't say just because I 'm an American , let 's gloss over that stuff .
And sometimes you 've got to be willing to walk alone .
I get most of my courage from my wife .
When I went through my trauma , she was right there with me .
I 'm very thankful to have a wise woman on my team .

Junkbunny Who Tried Buying Xanax Off Turtleboy Tried Suing EMT After She Came After Him On An Ambulance Ride And Has Declared War On Turtle Riders
Junkbunny Who Tried Buying Xanax Off Turtleboy Tried Suing EMT After She Came After Him On An Ambulance Ride And Has Declared War On Turtle RidersWant to advertise with Turtleboy ?
Email us at Turtleboysports @ gmail .
com for more information .
For the first time ever today two junkboxes messaged the Turtleboy business page to ask if we had Xanax for sale .
But Jessica Kane was just warming up .
Because it was n't enough to message a blog that frequently shames junkboxes and ratchets , looking for drugs , she had to take on turtle riders too…… .
`` I 'll beat ur ass corn .
`` That 's a new one .
As you can see she is alleging that we are the ones who solicited her to see if she wanted to buy drugs off us .
Ya got that ?
This is what Turtleboys do every day .
We scour the Internet looking for junkboxes to sell our excess zannies to .
Definitely .
Anyway , turns out she does n't have a drug problem , her `` job '' just does n't offer health insurance .
Naturally then her only recourse was to message Turtleboy and see what he was charging .
She ca n't afford health insurance , but cash money sure ai n't a problem : That right there is a lot of mushroom tip participation trophies !
! As you can see , she 's sticking to her story that we messaged her first , which obviously makes TONS of sense .
She kept posting a screenshot showing what appears to be us contacting her first , asking if she was looking for zannies .
She just forgot that in the very blog she was commenting on anyone could clearly see that she was the one who initiated contact : Oops !
! After that it was time to bust out the CAPS LOCK !
! Thirteen years is a long time to be prescribed Xanax .
And by `` prescribed '' she means , `` treated Diego to a basket lunch in exchange for illegal narcotics .
`` Up next was the `` I 'll fuck everyone up '' portion of the Gospel of Ratchet : Yea guys , she 's totally not a junkie .
She just so happens to message random community Facebook pages looking to score drugs .
And occasionally she gets busted with crack cocaineBesides that she 's totally NOT a junkie .
But it 's all good in the hood because she got that shit dismissed !
! Therefore she never got caught with crack cocaine .
( P. S. turtle riders are savage ) Next up in the ratchet script was the threat to call the cops : So if you 're keeping score at home , this woman approached us about buying drugs , admitted to the cops that she did so , and the cops responded by turning their focus on cyberbullying .
Because NOTHING IS MORE SERIOUS THAN CYBERBULLYING , EVEN ADDICTION !
! You ca n't make this stuff up .
Only on Turtleboy .
This is why we are the greatest blog that 's ever existed .
Good luck finding this sort of entertainment at Barstool .
But her story checks out because her uncle is the chief of police : We just do n't know what town he 's the chief of police in .
Wherever he is , I 'm sure her imaginary uncle would be thrilled to find his junkie niece name dropping him on Turtleboy .
But wait , it gets better .
Last year she made headlines when she was getting her biweekly free ambulance ride to the ER when she claimed she was abused by one of the first responders .
And in one of the greatest MSM fails of all time , NCB `` Investigative '' Team fell for her act hook , line , and sinkerThat interview was amazing .
She literally puts on a blazer and some non-prescription glasses and the schmucks on this `` I-Team '' just assume she 's a law-abiding non-ratchet member of society .
A local woman turned to the NBC 10 I-Team for answers after she captured a confrontation inside a North Providence ambulance on cell phone video .
The video shows an EMT lashing out at her , appearing to slap her in the face and swearing at her several times .
`` He then smacked me across my face , '' Jessica Kane said of the July 30 incident .
North Providence officers were responding to a domestic disturbance call when they came into contact with Kane , who is epileptic .
A police report obtained by NBC 10 shows the officers saw her have a seizure and lose consciousness .
They called the North Providence Fire Department for medical aid , and an ambulance arrived a short time later .
`` As soon as I was put into the rescue , I was called a drug addict , which I am not , '' she said .
`` I was just belittled so much .
It made me feel like the people here to treat me were there to just accuse me .
`` Oh yea , she 's TOTALLY not a drug addict .
She 's just been arrested for crack cocaine and messages random Facebook pages with 99,000 followers to see if they can sell her Xanax .
Oh , and her raspy `` life kicked the shit out of me and I 'm only 26 '' voice was n't a dead giveaway or anything like that .
The video shows the EMT appear to slap Kane in the face , causing her to drop her phone .
`` That 's assault ! ''
she screams on the tape .
`` I 'll give you assault ! ''
the man responds .
Watch the video if you have n't already .
She 's all fucked up and aggressive and is taping the guy who probably knows her middle name , date of birth , and blood type because he deals with her so often .
She wo n't shut the fuck up and approaches him while taping .
She gets too close .
He pushes her away from him .
Assault .
That 's how stupid the NBC 10 `` I-Team '' is .
The unidentified EMT can also be heard telling Kane to `` shut the ( expletive ) up. ``
She said the verbal abuse continued once she arrived at the hospital , moments not captured in the video .
`` He said , ‘ If you do n't get the F up off this stretcher , I 'm going to rip you by your hair , ' '' Kane told NBC 10 .
Funny that none of that is on the tape .
Guess we 'll just have to take this crackbunny 's word for it .
NBC 10 also reviewed the police report from officers who arrived that day .
They noted that Kane was difficult to deal with , writing that , `` Jessica was yelling and screaming in the middle of the road '' and was `` extremely belligerent. ``
The police report continues , saying that Kane `` became hostile , trying to unbuckle herself and get off the stretcher .
`` Boom .
Mystery solved .
Kane was released after spending about five hours at Fatima Hospital , and her cell phone was returned .
That 's when she said she found the video she recorded in the ambulance in her iPhone 's `` Recently Deleted '' folder .
She believes someone tried to erase it while the phone was out of her control .
`` I actually received my phone back and I saw that they tried to delete the video , '' she said .
Oh yea , I 'm sure that 's what happened .
Why would she lie ?
She 's wearing a blazer and glasses !
! Kane hired an attorney and said she plans to file an assault complaint with Rhode Island State Police .
As of Wednesday , state police said they had not yet received the complaint or been contacted by Kane about the incident .
Translation - she called up Dick N. Vulva , never paid him , got high , and never followed through with her massive lawsuit .
Anyway , we were still confused how the hell Jessica Kane got the impression that we were zanny salesmen .
Turns out there was a whole background story : You ca n't make this shit up .
In August we blogged about this Lawrence ghettopoon selling Xanax on FacebookEvidently Jessica Kane read the headline of this blog , assumed that we were the ones selling zannies , waited until she got her check on the first of the month , and then hit us up for the hookup .
Just another day at Turtleboy .
Shit like this never gets old .
I love my job way too much .
One guy suggested that it was a slow week : Dude , not one , but two junkbunnies messaged us assuming we sell Xanax from our Facebook page .
If you do n't think that 's getting blogged about then you do n't know Turtleboy .
Exactly ! !
Someone gets it ! From now on I think this is what you people should start doing : Brilliant .
This could be a weekly segment .
We urge you to support the following local businesses .

Gold Price in December 2017 - Myriads of Signals and Analogies
Briefly : In our opinion , full ( 150 % of the regular full position ) speculative short positions in gold , silver and mining stocks are justified from the risk/reward perspective at the moment of publishing this alert .
Gold moved back and forth on Friday and the accompanying volume was high , but that 's not the only important thing that we can discuss today .
The week is over and we have weekly changes and weekly volume levels to analyze and we saw major moves in the important ratios .
Additionally , we discovered a self-similar pattern in gold that has critical and volatile implications going forward .
Let 's start with Friday 's session and the changes in the gold market ( chart courtesy of http : //stockcharts .
comGold moved sharply back and forth as both positive and negative data was released and ultimately it ended the session a few dollars higher ( based on kitco 's prices , the closing price was $ 1,279 .
60 ) .
Why was the reaction so significant ?
The reason could be technical - the apex of the triangle was likely to be accompanied by a turnaround and since we just saw a more visible top a couple of days ago and apparently gold does n't want to form a bottom here , then the only remaining outcome is a local daily top that does n't change much - which is what we saw .
Why do we think that gold does n't want to bottom here ?
Because if it did , it would have ended Friday 's session much higher .
If gold does n't want to move higher , then silver must really hate that `` thought '' .
The white metal declined once again and even though gold closed a bit higher , it managed to close lower .
The move lower by itself is already bearish as it took place on visible volume , but it 's very bearish once we take into account Thursday 's breakdown .
We previously commented on it in the following way : Silver declined and it reversed before the end of the session , which appears to be a reversal .
But does this reversal really have bullish implications ?
It does n't seem to be the case .
The volume was n't huge enough to confirm the reversal and it was not low enough to invalidate the bearish implications of the decline either .
The key thing to the proper analysis of the silver price swing is the awareness of what the USD and S & P 500 did .
The former declined a bit , while stocks truly soared , which created perfect circumstances for a silver rally .
Yet , instead of a rally , we saw a decline and a move below the rising support line based on the August and October lows .
Consequently , silver 's action was very bearish as it showed great weakness in this market .
Moreover , the mentioned support line could be viewed as a neck level of a head and shoulders pattern ( with a rather long right shoulder , similar to the one that we saw in the euro ) , which serves as an additional bearish indication ( it 's only a small addition to the bearish implications of the breakdown as such , as its implications are bearish regardless of the H & S formation being in place or not ) .
On Friday , the general stock market declined significantly but almost the entire decline was reversed before the end of the session .
If we consider Thursday and Friday together , the S & P 500 index still rallied considerably , but silver declined and was unable to invalidate its breakdown .
The implications are strongly bearish .
Let 's move back to gold for a few minutes .
In terms of the euro , the bearish signals are much more profound .
Gold has just broken below the rising , medium-term support line and the most recent local top was formed approximately at the apex of the triangle pattern ( in terms of time ) .
The latter makes it considerably more likely that an important top was just formed and thus that the breakdown that we just saw will be confirmed .
As far as the apex of the triangle is concerned , it 's actually a combination of two such patterns - they are based on the same tops and bottoms , but in one case ( red lines ) they are based on the intraday extremes and in the other case ( black lines ) they are based on the daily closing prices .
The most recent top took place right between the apexes created based on both patterns .
The mentioned breakdown is almost confirmed .
Almost , because we would prefer to see three consecutive closing prices below the support line to see it as strong resistance , but we have already seen two of them , a weekly close and also a failed attempt to move back above the line .
The breakdown is very close to being fully confirmed and the bearishness of the implications increased significantly based on Friday 's session .
Speaking of breakdowns , we saw one in the gold to S & P 500 ratio , which… is nothing new , but still quite exciting and important .
Why ?
Because due to several failed attempts to break below this level , we had to be skeptical toward the breakdown this time .
The question was : `` Would this time be any different ? ''
It turned out that this time was different as the ratio moved back to the previously broken level , verified it as support and then continued to move lower on huge volume ( precisely , the ratio itself does n't have volume , so what we mean is the ratio of volumes ) .
Why would the above be a big deal ?
Because this ratio moves in tune with gold when it comes to major price moves and - more importantly - there was only one similar case in the past 15 years when we saw a similar breakdown and it was in the early stages of the 2012 - 2013 decline .
Back then , it was a warning sign that practically nobody noticed .
You 'll probably not see it anywhere ( except for this publication ) this time either .
Naturally , the implications are strongly bearish as the breakdown now appears believable .
From the weekly point of view , we see that mining stocks declined and broke below the rising support lines based on the 2016 and 2017 lows and that the breakdown took place on big volume .
All that happened after two weeks of low-volume upswings that we commented on in last Monday 's alertFinally , the weekly volume levels in the GDX ETF paint a very bearish picture for the following weeks .
The GDX ETF is after 2 small , weekly rallies that were accompanied by very low volume when compared with the previous weeks .
The last week had less trading days , but that does n't explain the previous week 's low volume reading .
Moreover , we did n't see similarly low volume readings in the past Novembers , which suggests that we are correct to view the low volume levels as something important and meaningful .
The only comparable situation from the recent past took place in mid-2014 ( marked with a black arrow ) .
In the following weeks , the GDX price was cut by a third .
The bearish implications of the above just became more bearish as back in 2014 , the first big-volume weekly decline meant that the big slide had just begun .
The breakdown can also be seen in the case of the HUI to S & P 500 index ratio .
In other words , by looking at gold stocksother stocksAll in all , the medium-term outlook is clearly bearish based on the above and based on the factors that we discussed previously and it seems that we 've been correct to be holding the short positions in metals and miners ( especially in silver and miners ) .
Still , it seems that the vast majority of the potential that these positions have is still to be realized .
This is particularly the case given the similarities between what we 're seeing now and what we saw before the previous slides .
We already discussed some of those similarities above , but there 's also something else that is likely in play right now .
In early October , we described the analogy in performance between 2008 and the current period ( at the moment ) in gold stocks .
It was almost two months ago , so even if you read it at that time , it might be worth reading it once again todayhttps : //www .
sunshineprofits .
com/gold-silver/gold-trading/the-more-things-change-the-more-they-stay-the-same/However , today we are not going to repeat the October analysis - we are going to discuss something alike… in gold .
That 's right , the gold market features similarities to its performance back in 2008 .
Before moving to details , let 's state that the analogy is far from perfect .
That 's probably why we did n't discover it earlier .
However , it 's not the point to be picky about a technique , but rather to see if there is anything that it can give us and make us particularly aware of things that could come .
With regard to the latter goal in mind , it seems that we have something very valuable .
After the sharp rally , gold consolidated a bit ( late September 2008 and mid-2016 ) , then declined and moved close to the previous highs once again ( October 2008 and September 2017 ) .
The decline that started thereafter in 2008 was the biggest and sharpest decline in many years .
Naturally , this does not bode well for the near-term gold outlook .
Conversely , it seems that we can expect the most important part of the decline to be just around the corner .
The above implication is not the only interesting thing about the analogy , though .
The detail that could be important going forward is the moment when the decline took a breather .
At this time , the moves take more time , so the pauses could be longer and more visible as well and if we get enough bullish confirmations once gold moves to certain price levels , we might even adjust the trading position temporarily .
In 2008 , the first interim pause was at the most recent important low and the second pause was approximately the level from which the sharpest part of the previous huge rally started , which was strengthened by another support level ( the previous low ) .
We do n't have price levels that would be 100 % analogous , but we can see which levels are most similar .
In our view , the most recent important lows would be close to the $ 1,200 level ( March , May , and July 2017 bottoms ) and the next strong support will be provided by the $ 1,120 - $ 1,130 area .
That 's approximately from where gold soared most sharply in early 2016 and this level is strengthened by the December 2016 low .
These levels are most likely to generate support strong enough to trigger at least corrective rallies based on the analogy to what we saw in 2008 and based on their own strength as support .
Naturally , that 's what appears likely based on the data that we have today and the likely scenario could change as new developments unfold .
There 's one more thing that we left for the analytical dessert .
Namely , back in 2008 the previous key low ( September 2008 low , which is analogous to the late 2015 bottom ) did n't trigger even a small rally .
Consequently , even though a bottom or at least a correction will be widely expected once gold moves below $ 1,100 , gold may continue to move lower and slide through $ 1,050 like a hot knife through butter .
Finally , there 's one more thing that makes the current situation in gold similar to 2008 - the overall increase in the volume levels .
We already discussed , why the yearly volume levels at record highs should not be viewed as bullishYes , the volume has been growing almost constantly , but the 2008 and 2017 buildups in volume still stand out .
The growth is much sharper than in other years and no other period is comparable to those years .
Since the 2008 volume buildup was followed by a sharp decline in the precious metals sector , it seems that we might see something similar also this and/or the next year .
Summing up , there are multiple bearish signals in the gold market and in the rest of the precious metals sector and the analogies to previous major declines further support the bearish outlook .

In other words , it we are writing about a speculative position , it means that it is up-to-date on the day it was posted .
We are also featuring the initial target prices , so that you can decide whether keeping a position on a given day is something that is in tune with your approach ( some moves are too small for medium-term traders and some might appear too big for day-traders ) .
Plus , you might want to read why our stop-loss orders are usually relatively far from the current pricePlease note that a full position does n't mean using all of the capital for a given trade .
You will find details on our thoughts on gold portfolio structuringKey InsightsAs a reminder - `` initial target price '' means exactly that - an `` initial '' one , it 's not a price level at which we suggest closing positions .
If this becomes the case ( like it did in the previous trade ) we will refer to these levels as levels of exit orders ( exactly as we 've done previously ) .
Stop-loss levels , however , are naturally not `` initial '' , but something that , in our opinion , might be entered as an order .
Since it is impossible to synchronize target prices and stop-loss levels for all the ETFs and ETNs with the main markets that we provide these levels for ( gold , silver and mining stocks - the GDX ETF ) , the stop-loss levels and target prices for other ETNs and ETF ( among other : UGLD , DGLD , USLV , DSLV , NUGT , DUST , JNUG , JDST ) are provided as supplementary , and not as `` final '' .
This means that if a stop-loss or a target level is reached for any of the `` additional instruments '' ( DGLD for instance ) , but not for the `` main instrument '' ( gold in this case ) , we will view positions in both gold and DGLD as still open and the stop-loss for DGLD would have to be moved lower .
On the other hand , if gold moves to a stop-loss level but DGLD does n't , then we will view both positions ( in gold and DGLD ) as closed .
In other words , since it 's not possible to be 100 % certain that each related instrument moves to a given level when the underlying instrument does , we ca n't provide levels that would be binding .
The levels that we do provide are our best estimate of the levels that will correspond to the levels in the underlying assets , but it will be the underlying assets that one will need to focus on regarding the signs pointing to closing a given position or keeping it open .
We might adjust the levels in the `` additional instruments '' without adjusting the levels in the `` main instruments '' , which will simply mean that we have improved our estimation of these levels , not that we changed our outlook on the markets .
We are already working on a tool that would update these levels on a daily basis for the most popular ETFs , ETNs and individual mining stocks .

Gupta Patel Slams New Bill Passed To Teach Your Kids Anal Sex In Public School And He 's Fired Up Like A Samosa Fresh Out The Pan ! Want to advertise with Turtleboy ?
Email us at [ email protected ] Everyone knows and loves Gupta Patel - Turtleboy 's crazy Indian Tech Guy and proud convenience store proprietor .
He 's never blogged for us before but something caught his eye in the news that sent him reeling .
Let 's give him a warm welcome as he has a meltdown about the statehouse deciding to teach kids as young as 12 how to safely take it in the back door ! chutiyasTake a look at this nutty-ass booshit : From New Boston Postentirely along party lines on Thursday dictating how school districts teach sex education ; and just like two years ago , the biggest sticking point for the bill 's opponents was the lack of an opt-in stipulation for parents and guardians .
Unlike in 2015 , however , it is likely this version of the bill will reach the House floor for a vote , but it remains to be seen if lawmakers on the other side of the State House attach the failed parental opt-in amendment touted Thursday by House Minority Leader Bruce Tarr ( R-Gloucester ) .
Following the 31-6 vote in favor that saw the only Democratic opposition come from state Senator Michael Rush of West Roxbury , Tarr praised the `` robust and healthy debate '' that transpired Thursday afternoon but expressed `` hope that as it makes its way through the legislative process '' that lawmakers outside the Senate will wind up adopting proposals like a parental consent stipulation .
The bill 's lead sponsor , state Senator Sal DiDomenico ( D-Everett ) took issue with Tarr 's opt-in proposal .
`` This amendment would gut the bill , '' DiDomenico claimed , noting that the legislation already features an opt-out amendment for both parents and school districts .
`` This amendment would effectively take all the work we put together and throw it out the window .
`` We do not have opt-in for science , math , English — we do n't have any opt-in initiative for any other subjects in our schools — this subject in particular could save lives .
`` Other Democrats who spoke out in opposition to Tarr 's amendment included state Senator John Keenan of Quincy , Worcester 's Harriet Chandler , and Boston 's Sonia Chang-Diaz .
Keenan and Chang-Diaz added that a parental consent requirement would add an unnecessary level of bureaucracy , with Keenan claiming that it `` would require school districts to chase down the parents of every single student '' while Chang-Diaz noting that `` many of my colleagues in the chamber in the minority are avid proponents of small streamlined government .
`` Chandler claimed that an opt-in provision would result in a `` very limited number of people who would be taking advantage of it .
`` `` The alternative of what we 're talking about is our children learning about these behaviors from what they hear on the school bus or read on the Internet , '' she added .
State Senator Vinny deMacedo ( R-Plymouth ) , responding to Keenan 's point , used student field trips as an example of opt-in protocol .
`` I do n't think that 's an impossible hurdle to overcome , '' he said .
`` The reality is that asking parents if they 're comfortable with this or not is not a stretch by any means .
`` Tarr appeared to take issue with the claim linking parental approval to an added layer of bureaucracy .
`` Well well well , it is interesting that some of these folks have stood at this microphone and suggested somehow that obtaining parental consent is so burdensome that we should n't follow through with this , '' Tarr quipped .
`` Suggesting that the role of a parent should be subordinate to the role of bureaucracy , now that 's a deeply concerning thought .
`` Tarr also challenged DiDomenico 's claim that an opt-in provision would `` gut the bill .
`` `` That somehow this bill is jeopardized by the fact that we might want to involve parents in the decision making — what does that suggest about the priorities of the bill ? ''
Tarr questioned .
`` It suggests that somehow we ought to subordinate the role of the parent to the role of the state .
`` It 's also been suggested that we do n't have opt-in provisions for math , science , and other things , well that is true , but we also do n't have opt-out provisions for those things , because they do n't fit the same matter as the subject matter that we 're discussing here .
`` Conservative organizations , including the Massachusetts Family Institute , are vehemently opposed to the bill over the proposed curriculum 's subject matter , which suggests that instruction regarding sexual aspects such as anal intercourse is age-appropriate for children as young as 12 .
`` If you have to have an affirmative act from a parent in order to go on a school trip , should you not have to have the affirmative act of a parent to be involved in education that involves morality , subjective judgment , and important health matters ? ''
Tarr said .
`` I think the matter speaks for itself .
`` DiDomenico responded to Tarr 's argument by noting he is not looking to subvert the role of parents and countered that he `` would put this in the same category as English , math , and science .
`` `` In some respects I 'd put it ahead of those subjects , '' DiDomenico added .
`` There are life-ending , life-long consequences , and a critical mistake can change their lives forever .
`` State Senator Barbara L'Italien ( D-Andover ) also spoke , mentioning an incident in which her older sister became pregnant during high school .
`` Getting married at age 17 locked her into a life of virtual poverty , '' L'Italien said .
`` I wish there had been accurate health information when she was a student back in the '70s , I think her life might have changed dramatically .
`` There are times when government needs to be proactive , and protective , and this is one of those situations .
`` Sweet Baby Vishnu !
The anal sex education is age appropriate for 12 year old ?
What fucking version of goddamn Kama Sutra they been reading ?
The Paul Georgio translation ?
This Hindu had the very very bad nightmares after reading this news !
In my dream , my daughter , Gupta Jr , was back in the grade school .
I was watching my favorite American movie `` Mansion of Blood '' and Mindy Robinson was just about to show all the peoples her hot hot Samosas when my daughter come running through the door , She say `` Papa !
Papa !
I have the question about the sex ! ''
And I say `` Yes my little one , I have been preparing for this conversation long time .
Ask your papa your questions '' .
She say `` Papa , when will it stop hurting my ass so much ? ''
Your old Uncle Gupta almost had the bad heart attacks !
`` As it did in 2015 , the Massachusetts Senate passed a bill nearly entirely along party lines on Thursday dictating how school districts teach sex education ; and just like two years ago , the biggest sticking point for the bill 's opponents was the lack of an opt-in stipulation for parents and guardians .
`` Really ?
Uncle Gupta think the biggest sticking point probably gon na be the anal sex .
Seriously though .
You can opt out of goddamn Pledge of Allegiance in school in Massachusetts without facing the punishments , but you ca n't opt out of learning how to send your pork soldier to the battle in Brownsville ?
`` The bill 's lead sponsor , state Senator Sal DiDomenico ( D-Everett ) took issue with Tarr 's opt-in proposal .
`` This amendment would gut the bill , '' DiDomenico claimed , noting that the legislation already features an opt-out amendment for both parents and school districts .
`` This amendment would effectively take all the work we put together and throw it out the window .
`` We do not have opt-in for science , math , English — we do n't have any opt-in initiative for any other subjects in our schools — this subject in particular could save lives .
`` Ganesha , please take me now , These chutiyasState Senator Barbara L'Italien ( D-Andover ) also spoke , mentioning an incident in which her older sister became pregnant during high school .
`` Getting married at age 17 locked her into a life of virtual poverty , '' L'Italien said .
`` I wish there had been accurate health information when she was a student back in the '70s , I think her life might have changed dramatically .
Ms. Barbarabhen !
Did you really just say `` Damn , my sister 's life would be so much better now if only she had taken the rusty trombone in her swamp starfish that one time instead of in her hoo-ha .
`` ? ?
It Take one real classy lady to say she wishes her niece or nephew had taken a wrong turn down Willy Wonka 's garbage chute .
Uncle Gupta do n't think it 's too strange that Barbara L'Italien advocating for taking it from the behind .
Nobody gon na want to be looking at this in the face during the hot nookie-nookie session .
.
Holy mother of Kali !
Blowjob from this one probably count as anal anyways .
No surprise here really .
Both L'Italien and Chandler recently vote to give themselves fat pay hikeSweet baby Hannuman !
Her ass probably look like dying Yoda 's forehead .
Going to work up her Lincoln Log Factory probably sound like punching a fist into the open jar of Miracle Whip !
( Miracle Whip !
Two jars for five dollar at my Main South Happy Hindu Mart Convenience Store in Worcester .
Next five minute only . )
She so old her dunghole probably look like the hopper on a meat grinder after Porketta night .
This one Sonia Chang-Diaz though ? Would .
This Hindu just saying .
`` There are times when government needs to be proactive , and protective , and this is one of those situations .
`` I agreeing that government should be protective and proactive .
Maybe if they had voted to give the Police the Kevlar Vests instead of giving their fat samosa asses big raiseState Legislators are calling this bill the `` Healthy Youth Act '' .
That really nice way of putting it .
As usual with these `` Dheela Lund Ni Olaad '' ( That my Gujarati language for `` Sons of the broken penis '' ) , the devil is in the details…and Uncle Gupta all about the details !
One of the textbooks approved in the bill is called `` Get Real : Comprehensive Sex Education That Works , '' put out by the Planned Parenthood .
Book is only available in bundles of 50 , and this thrifty Indian man not buying if he ca n't find the coupon or get the good deal .
I ferret couple passages out on the internets for you .
You 're welcome .
One lesson teaches the childrens that A dental dam is `` placed over the vulva or anus during oral sex '' .
Then it goes on to say the people can also use the `` Non-Microwaveable Saran Wrap '' .
Papa Gupta spend most of his daughter 's pre-teen years yelling at her to do the healthy things .
`` Do n't touch that !
Do not step in the dog mess !
Do n't put the statue of Baby Krishna in your mouth !
Wash Your hands before eating !
Use the Purell after shaking Senator McGovern 's hand ! `` .
Now , she would have to go to school next day and learn how to toss the big salad ? ?
It 's ok though… .
Happy Hindu Mart sell plenty of non-microwaveable Saran Wrap .
This handsome Indian TurtleBoy do n't think Saran Wrap company be too happy knowing sex education class teaching the children to use their product to cover the chocolate cannoli .
Another lesson talk about using the `` internal condom that is inserted into the anus. ``
They say it acts as a barrier but warns that `` it may slip out of place during vaginal or anal intercourse and may be difficult to insert .
`` Wait…what you say ?
I had to call my cousin the Gastroenterologist about this one .
Dr. Dharmendra Tubupyeresh .
I say `` Hey , Dharmendra , you ever hear of such thing ? ''
He say to me `` Gupta , you been lighting up the porn hub again ?
Yes there is such the thing. ``
He send me over this picture .
`` Insert two fingers inside the condom and gently push it into the anal cavity .
The inner ring can be removed after inserted if desired .
`` Lovely .
12 year old gon na learn how to shove the ziplock bag up the friend 's wazoo before doing the zoom-zoom in the boom-boom .
When Uncle Gupta first read this news , he knew something smell funny…and not just the anal sex !
Then this bald prick rears his ugly head and everything make sense…Senator Jamie Eldridge .
You might remember him from such blogs as these .
This Hindu gets it .
Too many kids having the sex at young age… Definitely should be options available to teach healthy sexual practices to children , but if any citizen ever texted the contents of some of these lessons to a child , they would go to the prison .
And we all know what happen in prison .
Dunghole come out looking like Saarlac sand monster from the Return of the Jedi .
Anyway , this Hindu try hard to reach these senators on Twitter but they not responding .
Wonder why .
Namaste TurtleBoy Nations !
May the supple trunk of Ganesha goose your buttocks !
